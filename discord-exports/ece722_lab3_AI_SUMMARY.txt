- SDC file naming conflicts, cleaning up lab files, and test verification are still to be addressed in Lab 3.
- Important tips for checking if the golden file names match expected format, not carelessly removing or re-cloning lab files, watching for SDC path mismachkees, and staying focused on timeline.
