[11/24/2025, 1:56:33 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
`naiveadder` should have an `in_valid` and `out_valid` right? Else the tb won't work

[11/24/2025, 1:57:00 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Also, if we wanna use CSA for our `naiveadder`, we can add an M parameter here right? @nachiketkapre

[11/24/2025, 2:03:44 PM] nachiketkapre:
Bake it in (M)

[11/24/2025, 2:04:12 PM] nachiketkapre:
And yes it needs the valids too

[11/24/2025, 2:05:14 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Small fix to tb for `test_adder.sv`. Or else you get this error:

[11/24/2025, 2:09:45 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
`naiveadder` should have its output pin `s` renamed to `sum` to algin with the `test_adder.sv` tb

[11/24/2025, 2:12:24 PM] nachiketkapre:
Thanks that too

[11/24/2025, 2:16:34 PM] nachiketkapre:
Yeah thi was fixed in my solution

[11/24/2025, 2:17:40 PM] nachiketkapre:
Is this just splitting declaration and assignment??

[11/24/2025, 2:24:14 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Pretty much

[11/24/2025, 2:24:42 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Verilator being Verilator and complaining

[11/24/2025, 7:35:43 PM] jianxiwang:
@nachiketkapre so we are actually using 512-bit input and pad 0's to make it 2048 bit?

[11/24/2025, 7:36:54 PM] nachiketkapre:
No?

[11/24/2025, 7:37:00 PM] jianxiwang:
that will fail all test cases that expect c_out=1 because MSB will just be in sum insted of overflow to cout

[11/24/2025, 7:37:08 PM] nachiketkapre:
Is my random generator producing large numbers???

[11/24/2025, 7:37:35 PM] jianxiwang:
it seems to use 512-bit numbers rather than 2048

[11/24/2025, 7:38:01 PM] nachiketkapre:
Check the test adder code?

[11/24/2025, 7:38:04 PM] nachiketkapre:
Maybe bug

[11/24/2025, 7:40:11 PM] jianxiwang:
yes i'm checking

[11/24/2025, 7:42:47 PM] jianxiwang:
a.hex and b.hex under `data/` are 512-bit numbers, not 2048

[11/24/2025, 7:43:36 PM] jianxiwang:
tb looks fine to me, just the data not wide enough, from what i found

[11/24/2025, 7:43:46 PM] nachiketkapre:
the data generator?

[11/24/2025, 7:43:55 PM] nachiketkapre:
data/generate_adder_data.py?

[11/24/2025, 7:44:17 PM] jianxiwang:
checking those

[11/24/2025, 7:48:38 PM] jianxiwang:
when i specify the `--width 2048` it can generate the correct 2048-sized output: `python generate_adder_data.py --width 2048`

[11/24/2025, 7:49:19 PM] nachiketkapre:
did you do `make data...`?

[11/24/2025, 7:50:15 PM] jianxiwang:
no i just run the raw python cmd

[11/24/2025, 7:50:35 PM] jianxiwang:
are we supposed to generate test case on our own?

[11/24/2025, 7:50:46 PM] nachiketkapre:
Check makefile

[11/24/2025, 7:50:49 PM] nachiketkapre:
there's a data target

[11/24/2025, 7:51:01 PM] nachiketkapre:
`make data DUT=<youradder> W=2048`

[11/24/2025, 7:54:22 PM] jianxiwang:
```

[11/24/2025, 7:54:32 PM] jianxiwang:
i'll disable exhaustive

[11/24/2025, 7:55:49 PM] jianxiwang:
what is this TESTS for?

[11/24/2025, 7:56:00 PM] nachiketkapre:
to lmiit number of tests

[11/24/2025, 7:56:12 PM] nachiketkapre:
if you don't define it it'll switch to exhaustive

[11/24/2025, 7:56:49 PM] jianxiwang:
ok `make data DUT=naiveadder2048b W=2048 TESTS=10` works fine for me

[11/24/2025, 7:57:12 PM] jianxiwang:
it is 2048 bit now

[11/24/2025, 7:58:08 PM] jianxiwang:
so are we supposed to generate data on our own? or we use the same consistent data?

[11/24/2025, 7:58:25 PM] nachiketkapre:
i gave you a script?

[11/24/2025, 7:58:28 PM] nachiketkapre:
what do you mean?

[11/24/2025, 7:58:32 PM] nachiketkapre:
just use it to generate data

[11/24/2025, 7:58:42 PM] nachiketkapre:
you're welcome to add corner cases if that's what you mean

[11/25/2025, 8:34:30 AM] nachiketkapre:
@here grader on lab3 is still running.

[11/25/2025, 8:34:35 AM] nachiketkapre:
been a day!

[11/25/2025, 8:36:59 AM] nachiketkapre:
Most common error so far... may be student groups that dropped the course.. but just FYI

[11/25/2025, 8:37:13 AM] nachiketkapre:
Some Quartus errors

[11/25/2025, 8:37:58 AM] nachiketkapre:
Some kids forgetting to check-in scripts

[11/25/2025, 8:38:23 AM] n1ko0303:
Chmod +x

[11/25/2025, 8:38:25 AM] nachiketkapre:
I haven't seen this one.... this is new

[11/25/2025, 8:38:41 AM] nachiketkapre:
That's your job not mine.. I only chmod +x the base scripts

[11/25/2025, 8:39:24 AM] nachiketkapre:
but here it sounds like the file either doesn't exist

[11/25/2025, 8:39:52 AM] n1ko0303:
What I do is chmod +x  *.sh

[11/25/2025, 8:40:15 AM] n1ko0303:
So I don’t bother going through them one by one

[11/25/2025, 8:46:34 AM] creeperdrop:
Oh that'll be a rough ride

[11/25/2025, 8:46:38 AM] poofypigeon:
I saw something similar to this on Lab4 where everything works fine until I run `source env.sh` in that terminal session...?

[11/25/2025, 8:48:09 AM] emirguevara:
you can declare it and then do
assign variable = value;

[11/25/2025, 8:48:52 AM] poofypigeon:
oh right this came up before didn't it

[11/25/2025, 8:49:04 AM] emirguevara:
it is a good warning

[11/25/2025, 8:49:15 AM] emirguevara:
yes

[11/25/2025, 8:52:20 AM] poofypigeon:
well you added an explicit `static` in front of the same line for the lab4 file... are you sure you haven't seen this?

[11/25/2025, 9:07:20 AM] nachiketkapre:
But not for lab3

[11/25/2025, 9:07:40 AM] nachiketkapre:
Only one kids code has this error for some reason

[11/25/2025, 9:07:54 AM] poofypigeon:
As long as I'm not that kid

[11/25/2025, 9:08:02 AM] poofypigeon:
🙃

[11/25/2025, 9:09:09 AM] poofypigeon:
But I'm guessing it's something to do with verilator version sourced

[11/25/2025, 9:13:29 AM] nachiketkapre:
that might be it

[11/25/2025, 9:13:38 AM] nachiketkapre:
still odd

[11/25/2025, 11:36:29 AM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
I don't think a hardcoded width of 32 is what we want for the prefix tb...

[11/25/2025, 11:46:11 AM] nachiketkapre:
gets overriden with verilator flags

[11/25/2025, 12:02:47 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
I see in the makefile. But when I run `make sim DUT=prefix_tree N=64`, (for example) I get the width to still be 32 (if I revert my changes). So this might not be working as intended

[11/25/2025, 12:17:34 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
I think Makefile is fine, prefix tb needs to be updated

[11/25/2025, 12:17:38 PM] nachiketkapre:
isn't DUT_PARAMS passed to verilator? Check teh verilator command?

[11/25/2025, 12:17:49 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Yeah that's all good

[11/25/2025, 12:18:39 PM] nachiketkapre:
It should be using N from the +define

[11/25/2025, 12:20:25 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Verilator is, but the tb is not. For example, in the test_adder tb, its the same flow of using DUT_PARAMS for W and M, but it doesn't have hardcoded values

[11/25/2025, 12:20:49 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
For prefix tree, that hardcoded 32 needs to be replaced with ``WIDTH`

[11/25/2025, 12:22:16 PM] nachiketkapre:
ok

[11/25/2025, 12:22:31 PM] nachiketkapre:
Safe to fix?

[11/25/2025, 12:22:50 PM] nachiketkapre:
Wait why WIDTH? and not N

[11/25/2025, 12:24:59 PM] nachiketkapre:
Just tested with `N and it works

[11/25/2025, 12:25:19 PM] nachiketkapre:
also tested with hardcoded 32 and it work too dafaq?

[11/25/2025, 12:27:15 PM] nachiketkapre:
but `N is correct

[11/25/2025, 12:27:28 PM] nachiketkapre:
32 happens to work if I geneated data with larger width and also works with smaller width because it pads 0s

[11/25/2025, 12:27:31 PM] nachiketkapre:
wow wtf 😛

[11/25/2025, 12:28:06 PM] nachiketkapre:
pishing fix

[11/25/2025, 12:41:48 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Yeah sorry, `N is right

[11/27/2025, 3:49:22 PM] haibo3431:

thanks man

[11/27/2025, 5:59:21 PM] haibo3431:
anyone knows where does `c_in` and `c_out` go in the diagram here?

[11/27/2025, 5:59:42 PM] haibo3431:
like `c_out` i can make it as the `c_out` of the MSB adder

[11/27/2025, 5:59:50 PM] haibo3431:
what i should do with `c_in`?

[11/27/2025, 6:00:35 PM] nachiketkapre:
Umm that’s something you should solve on your own

@nachiketkapre For the naiive adder, assigning M in `make {synth|sim} M={}` is not working. It follows whatever was assigned to M in the design as default. It is most likely because of the variable `ARCH_PARAM_VAL` as it is not assigned

[11/27/2025, 10:37:13 PM] nachiketkapre:
Yup a quick fix incoming

[11/27/2025, 10:37:19 PM] creeperdrop:
Fixed it

[11/27/2025, 10:37:25 PM] creeperdrop:
Thanks still!

Maybe you're using too many FFs, resources!?

[11/28/2025, 1:05:23 PM] nachiketkapre:
I see no resource exhausted

[11/28/2025, 1:05:39 PM] haibo3431:
ok i see. can't be too naive then

[11/28/2025, 1:14:42 PM] nachiketkapre:
Our naive solution takes ~20-30 mins to compile

[11/28/2025, 1:18:35 PM] haibo3431:
ok thank you for the reference.

[11/28/2025, 1:40:00 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Is that for sim or fit?

[11/28/2025, 1:40:18 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Nvm this is fit

[11/28/2025, 1:40:24 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
How long is sim supposed to take?

[11/28/2025, 3:59:52 PM] kunj99:
Depends, here is what I found:

Naive Adder ( M= 10):  ~ 1min 30 sec

as i increase M, the time taken to run the sim decreases.

[11/28/2025, 8:32:57 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
How many tests are you running?

[11/28/2025, 8:40:18 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Are we expected to use retiming and the hyperflex registers in order to meet the thresholds?

[11/28/2025, 8:40:57 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Also, are we just aiming for max frequency this time? That's what it seems like with the README

[11/28/2025, 8:41:20 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Time to read!

[11/28/2025, 8:41:36 PM] nachiketkapre:
The clever solution is much cheaper

[11/28/2025, 8:41:40 PM] nachiketkapre:
And compiles way faster

[11/28/2025, 8:42:09 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
So for picking the M value for naive, is it just a judgement call? No way we sweep

[11/28/2025, 8:46:09 PM] nachiketkapre:
You sweep

[11/28/2025, 8:46:10 PM] nachiketkapre:
Not me

[11/28/2025, 8:46:17 PM] nachiketkapre:

[11/28/2025, 9:11:27 PM] n1ko0303:
anyone got the same issue?

[11/28/2025, 9:11:56 PM] n1ko0303:
I have updated the repository with the changes professor made recently

[11/28/2025, 9:12:45 PM] rwsos_:
not too sure about the last error but first two fix here ^

[11/28/2025, 9:22:10 PM] n1ko0303:
nevermind the issue is in the Makefile line 29

[11/28/2025, 9:22:25 PM] n1ko0303:
VFLAGS += -Wno-SELRANGE -Wno-WIDTHEXPAND -Wno-WIDTHTRUNC -Wno-IMPLICITSTATIC -DTESTDIR=\"$(PWD)/data/\" -DTOP=$(TOP)

[11/28/2025, 10:07:50 PM] n1ko0303:
how to make the rca_pipe.sv part of the System verilog? so what is going on is that my cleveradder2048b.sv is looking for the rca_pipe.sv but it was not the part of it before have anyone else had the same issue?

[11/28/2025, 10:08:22 PM] n1ko0303:
I am looking for it in the documentation but I cant

[11/28/2025, 10:08:28 PM] n1ko0303:
anyone with the simmilar issue

[11/28/2025, 10:09:59 PM] kunj99:
the most i tried is 100 test vectors, doesn't take longer than 2-3 min for both naive and clever

[11/28/2025, 10:11:28 PM] kunj99:
if you don't want to edit the setup.tcl you can just add ``include "rca_pipe.sv"` at the top of you naive adder .sv

[11/28/2025, 10:12:56 PM] n1ko0303:
oohh ok I see that makes sense

[11/28/2025, 10:14:04 PM] n1ko0303:
fixed it thanks @Kunj

[11/28/2025, 10:18:05 PM] n1ko0303:
I wonder will it affect the execution if I will do both? like add the include line and change the setup.tcl

[11/28/2025, 10:18:20 PM] n1ko0303:
let me do some experiments

[11/28/2025, 10:21:47 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Either I'm rate limited or my implementation sucks...

[11/28/2025, 10:22:29 PM] n1ko0303:
yeah it takes 3 minute max on my side too

[11/28/2025, 10:22:33 PM] n1ko0303:
use the razorcrest

[11/28/2025, 10:22:38 PM] n1ko0303:
noeone here

[11/28/2025, 10:22:42 PM] kunj99:
make sim is fine, but make fit takes its sweet time on naive

[11/28/2025, 10:23:37 PM] n1ko0303:
sims run in one minute or two on razorcrest 

fit for the clever runs a bit longer than on the naive

[11/28/2025, 10:24:03 PM] n1ko0303:
maybe 4 minutes for the naive and 6-7 for the clever

[11/28/2025, 11:30:38 PM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
Yeah I think uwing is doomed. 30 min for synth 😭

[11/28/2025, 11:42:35 PM] n1ko0303:
are you doing the sweep?

[11/28/2025, 11:42:43 PM] n1ko0303:
dont do the sweep

[11/28/2025, 11:42:56 PM] n1ko0303:
use the M and W values given already

[11/28/2025, 11:44:03 PM] jimmywzp6:
where it is given

[11/28/2025, 11:45:44 PM] n1ko0303:
To enable autograding, please create {naive|clever}.sh scripts to run your
fitting script and to populate results/winner_{naive|clever}.csv in one shot
(no sweep!!).

[11/28/2025, 11:46:57 PM] n1ko0303:
if you are doing sweep autograder will give you 0

[11/28/2025, 11:47:36 PM] jimmywzp6:
So do I need use sweep first  to find best M

[11/28/2025, 11:48:05 PM] n1ko0303:
yes

[11/28/2025, 11:48:17 PM] n1ko0303:
first sweep and find it and plug it in the script automatically

[11/28/2025, 11:48:22 PM] n1ko0303:
so it will run that M only

[11/28/2025, 11:48:37 PM] n1ko0303:
basically start 8 16 32 64 128 I would not go beyond that

[11/28/2025, 11:48:59 PM] n1ko0303:
even 128 is too much tbh but run as much as you want whatever gives you the best Fmax from the listed

[11/28/2025, 11:49:00 PM] n1ko0303:
use that

[11/28/2025, 11:49:03 PM] n1ko0303:
basically

[11/28/2025, 11:49:44 PM] n1ko0303:
I am just test running everything with fixed value making it work on only one M and W values and then I will write the sweep script that will go and find the best solution and I will plug that in to my fit script

[11/28/2025, 11:49:46 PM] n1ko0303:
that is all

[11/28/2025, 11:50:00 PM] n1ko0303:
that is how I understood the lab manual Idk...

[11/28/2025, 11:50:35 PM] n1ko0303:
plus for the monster adders you have to read the paper again, there are some specific parts you have to change in your clever verilog to make it work

[11/28/2025, 11:50:46 PM] n1ko0303:
this is for the part 2 of the lab

[11/28/2025, 11:51:19 PM] n1ko0303:
actually W stays always the same so you dont touch it, just change M

[11/28/2025, 11:52:17 PM] n1ko0303:
I guess prof made it requirement like this for running the autograder faster

[11/28/2025, 11:52:41 PM] n1ko0303:
or last time it took days, and if bug in the grading script than you have to rerun for couple more days to fix it

[11/28/2025, 11:53:15 PM] n1ko0303:
so now if better M exists and you wont find it you get 0 I assume

[11/28/2025, 11:57:16 PM] jimmywzp6:
cannot run data

[11/28/2025, 11:57:22 PM] jimmywzp6:
make data

[11/28/2025, 11:59:41 PM] n1ko0303:
use this I think you forgot to add the tests parameter

[11/28/2025, 11:59:42 PM] n1ko0303:
make data DUT=cleveradder2048b W=2048 M=64 TESTS=100

[11/29/2025, 12:00:06 AM] n1ko0303:
you can change the tests parameter dynamically

[11/29/2025, 12:00:13 AM] n1ko0303:
its an example command

[11/29/2025, 12:00:17 AM] jimmywzp6:
ok

[11/29/2025, 12:00:22 AM] jimmywzp6:
thk u TA

[11/29/2025, 12:00:43 AM] n1ko0303:
lol naah bro, I am just trying to figure things out as you do

[11/29/2025, 1:14:01 AM] n1ko0303:
what is the command that you are trying to run

[11/29/2025, 1:14:53 AM] jimmywzp6:
make synth

[11/29/2025, 1:17:37 AM] n1ko0303:
did you pull the new makefile from git?

[11/29/2025, 1:17:42 AM] n1ko0303:
it was updated 23 hours ago

[11/29/2025, 1:17:54 AM] n1ko0303:
prof found bug in it

[11/29/2025, 1:18:24 AM] n1ko0303:
also change this line I have changed it to the following since it was throwing issues for me for some reason:

VFLAGS += -Wno-SELRANGE -Wno-WIDTHEXPAND -Wno-WIDTHTRUNC -Wno-IMPLICITSTATIC -DTESTDIR="$(PWD)/data/" -DTOP=$(TOP)

[11/29/2025, 1:21:08 AM] n1ko0303:
but if the test is passing all the random tests you do not need to run the synth

[11/29/2025, 1:21:20 AM] n1ko0303:
but its good to double check on different M values I agree

[11/29/2025, 1:21:54 AM] n1ko0303:
using the make ... test=100,1000 ....

[11/29/2025, 1:25:24 AM] jimmywzp6:
Okay I’ll try it

[11/29/2025, 1:27:16 AM] n1ko0303:
TEST SUMMARY:
  Total tests run: 1000
  Passed: 1000
  Failed: 0
  GRADE: 1
  Result: ALL TESTS PASSED!

if you are receving message like this most likely you are good that is what I am trying to say, but double check by running the synth for the different values anyways

[11/29/2025, 10:45:16 AM] bananamilkenjoyer443:
We're looking for Fmax (restricted) right? And if we have a tie between M values, pick the the one with least area?

[11/29/2025, 11:09:22 AM] nachiketkapre:
Yes

[11/29/2025, 11:58:08 AM] n1ko0303:
did everyone start executing their code on razorcrest?
