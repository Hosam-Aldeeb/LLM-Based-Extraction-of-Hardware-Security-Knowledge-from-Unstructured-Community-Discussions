💬 [4] ani_thegeneral68 (6:40:24 PM)
Is it ili9341 or ili9225

💬 [5] jimlee5027 (6:40:51 PM) [REPLY]
Change  tft.fillScreen(ILI9341_WHITE); to  tft.fillScreen(ILI9341_GREEN);  And see if it changes anything.

💬 [6] m3kishiku (6:55:05 PM) [REPLY]
the screen has these pins: CS, DC, RTS, SDA, SCK, VCC, GND

💬 [7] m3kishiku (6:56:47 PM) [REPLY]
i dont know it was given to me and when i search up the model 2.4" TFT SPI 240X320 GMT024-10 V2.1 nothing comes up

💬 [8] m3kishiku (6:57:02 PM) [REPLY]
nope it didnt even work that time

💬 [9] ani_thegeneral68 (7:01:18 PM)
It’s ili9341 

So library is aight

💬 [10] ani_thegeneral68 (7:04:58 PM) [REPLY]
I’m guessing this is an example program 
Not something u wrote 

If so  
Program has to be correct but 

The wiring may be a bit loose 

So u gotta start there 

If not then it could be the libraries

💬 [11] ani_thegeneral68 (7:06:31 PM)
U might hv to find a newer version 

If ur is already the latest one 
U might need to downgrade it a few versions

💬 [12] jimlee5027 (12:11:53 AM) [REPLY]
Actually what's messing you up is that it never worked. White is the default color when it's not talking to the processor.

would you help withh our last question- the 2.8' tft lcd screen?

💬 [37] anonengineering (12:05:11 AM)
that is another shield, so if it isn't working either i think your display uses a different chip, so you need a different library

💬 [38] fastbeluga._18348 (12:05:35 AM)
oooh

💬 [39] fastbeluga._18348 (12:05:40 AM)
like what libary

💬 [96] sefuin0519 (1:28:47 AM)
Hii, I did some arduino for projects back in the day but I decided to get into it again. Today I made a super simple vibration sensor that detects when I shoot a wood target with an airsoft bb gun and makes a noise. 

It's always been a childhood dream to have a range that does this. I was thinking of somehow getting the arduinos to communicate with each other and score points based on. A Targets hit B. Targets missed C. Time it took to complete course. Then display this on a tablet scoreboard or something. Of course I don't know how to do this but do you think it would be a good project for a beginner to work on?

Hey guys, I just bought an arduino mega, what are some good videoes to watch to have a general understanding of arduino?

💬 [2] penpengu (8:02:29 AM) [REPLY]
if you know absolutely nothing about arduino then there's a very long but also very good series on youTube "new arduino tutorials" by paul mcworther. 
For now you could think of the arduino mega as just an arduino uno but with more pins, more ram and more flash. So 99% or arduino uno tutorials still apply. (There are some things that the mega can do or can do better than an uno but afaik nothing the other way around)

🤓 as per *Pengudash*'s explanation you should be able to try out your MEGA using UNO diagrams... so same with the simulators I suggested *(so there's 0 change you damage your microcontroller board while you're wrapping your head around the concepts involved)* ... 
👉 the key is to try it as you learn... & keep learning as you go for more & more complicated projects...

💬 [6] mik_07 (10:08:52 PM) [REPLY]
Thanks! Will do 🙂

💬 [7] mik_07 (10:09:46 PM) [REPLY]
I see, is it possible to damage the board by putting in code that is wrong?

🎯 [8] toph2814 (10:19:30 PM) [REPLY]
shouldn't be an issue unless you're messing about with flashing bootloaders from random HEX files....
👉 as long as you're using the Arduino IDE then it should be reversible as long as you select the correct board before uploading your code... *(procedures that are covered in Paul's tutorials)* ...

Depends on the battery specs and solar panel specs

💬 [7] cmrsherpderp (11:58:21 PM)
If the solar panel only generates 1v and the battery voltage is 6v it won’t charge

💬 [8] cmrsherpderp (11:59:00 PM)

Is 3s better than tp4060 or something?

💬 [48] klevi_ (6:15:16 AM) [REPLY]
Well, you want to use a 3S setup, so 3 cells in series to output 11.1V volts. You need a charger that can handle that

💬 [49] akithmari (8:43:56 AM) [REPLY]
I see.
Im actually planning to paralel the batteries with tp4060 but i think ill stick to 3s

💬 [50] klevi_ (8:45:33 AM) [REPLY]
If you pararell them, you won't have an 11 v output

💬 [51] akithmari (8:51:16 AM) [REPLY]
I mean like this

💬 [52] klevi_ (8:55:55 AM) [REPLY]
That can work but the charge modules have a current limit. Have you calculated how long it would take to charge up? Are you sure that it's a TP4060 and not at TP4056?

💬 [53] akithmari (9:14:03 AM) [REPLY]
Oh yea my bad.
No i havent calculated yet cuz idk how to measure the battery current

💬 [1] .qwertypo (6:17:32 PM)
I think I fixed it

💬 [2] .qwertypo (6:17:55 PM)
I added ` SoftwareSerial rs485(RS485_WASTE, RS485_PIN); // (RX, TX) ` before the setup()

💬 [3] .qwertypo (6:18:18 PM)
And then changed my init to a void() so I could use the same code in the setup and then again in the loop

🎯 [4] .qwertypo (6:18:44 PM)
```
void initializeRS485() {
  bool dipOneState = DIP_ONE_STATE.read() == HIGH;

  // Reconfigure RS485 pins based on DIP switch state
  rs485.end(); // End previous instance
  if (dipOneState) {
    rs485 = SoftwareSerial(RS485_WASTE, RS485_PIN); // TX mode (RX, TX)
    Serial.println("TX Mode");
  } else {
    rs485 = SoftwareSerial(RS485_PIN, RS485_WASTE); // RX mode (RX, TX)

So i ran out of pin esp8266.
Is it better to use esp32 or use 74HC?

💬 [2] anonengineering (10:56:46 AM) [REPLY]
need to know more about what you are trying to do

making pest catcher. here's the design

🎯 [4] akithmari (11:14:50 AM)
here's the current schematic if i decided to use esp32. i need more pin for photodiodes for detecting if someone steal the device. but then i realised esp8266 doesn't have enough pin.

🎯 [5] anonengineering (2:16:50 PM) [REPLY]
different modules have different numbers of pins broken out, "ESP8266" and "ESP32" are chips, they don't describe the dev board you are using

Why does a stm32 have the audio?

💬 [2] erix1224 (1:07:05 PM)
Hello, I have an arduino and I remove the atmega chip from it, but it wont work, I read if the atmega chip comes with the arduino it not works without a brand new atmega328p, what can I do to make it work?

💬 [3] excsniper (1:07:55 PM)
What do you mean it won't work

You can't upload to an Arduino when you remove the atmega chip?

💬 [6] styxie_x (1:09:35 PM) [REPLY]
because it's reciving the analog signal (that's mixed from multiple other signals) i didnt have an external ADC for raspberry.

What can I do now?

💬 [12] excsniper (1:13:01 PM) [REPLY]
I'd prob use i2s but I don't know if the stm32 can be an i2s master. If not then you'll have to cook up a custom protocol over usb or spi. If you have to ask them none of these will be exactly trivial to do

💬 [13] excsniper (1:13:55 PM) [REPLY]
Buy one with bootloader or burn it yourself

💬 [1] dellungi (10:41:47 AM)
Is this what the arduino uno is when people say to get one as a beginner? What’s the REV3 mean?

💬 [2] .pseud0 (10:44:15 AM) [REPLY]
Revision 3

🎯 [3] .pseud0 (10:44:27 AM)
The Uno Revision 4 uses a different microcontroller, for example. A Renesas RA4M1.

💬 [4] dellungi (10:44:49 AM) [REPLY]
So which is the one people say to get when u first begin

💬 [5] .pseud0 (10:45:08 AM)
The most universally used and supported one is the Uno R3.

💬 [6] .pseud0 (10:45:13 AM)
Most resources are available for it

💬 [7] .pseud0 (10:45:18 AM)
and learning tutorials etc.

💬 [8] dellungi (10:45:18 AM) [REPLY]
Ok so it’s the one I sent?

💬 [9] .pseud0 (10:45:22 AM)
Yes.

💬 [10] dellungi (10:45:34 AM)
Ok do I need to buy anything else along with it

💬 [11] .pseud0 (10:45:51 AM)
The Uno R4 is more modern and powerful though, so if you need that and don't mind researching more, don't shy away from it.

💬 [12] .pseud0 (10:46:05 AM)
Well alongside a Uno R3, you should also have a basic set of electronic components and a project book / tutorials..

💬 [13] ixxcs (10:46:18 AM) [REPLY]
what are you making? what are you gonna do with board alone?

💬 [14] .pseud0 (10:46:19 AM)
That's why you usually start with an Uno R3 Starter Kit, e.g. from Elegoo.

💬 [15] dellungi (10:46:31 AM) [REPLY]
So should I buy both or just R4

💬 [16] dellungi (10:46:41 AM) [REPLY]
Idk I just wanna start with it and see

💬 [17] ixxcs (10:46:58 AM) [REPLY]
starter kit isn't worth it imo. you should have a project in mind and buy the required parts separately

💬 [18] .pseud0 (10:47:29 AM)
a complete beginner will value a hand-holding approach and selected components and projects very much

💬 [19] .pseud0 (10:47:47 AM)

So should I get R4 or R3

💬 [30] ixxcs (10:51:01 AM) [REPLY]
you should have something in mind tho. maybe google a few projects first.

💬 [31] ixxcs (10:52:28 AM) [REPLY]
R3 is most popular one. Almost all the tutorials are about it. R4 is a faster version of R3. So i guess go with R4

💬 [32] dellungi (10:52:55 AM) [REPLY]
I can still follow the tutorials all the same with R4 or will there be differences

💬 [33] dellungi (10:53:09 AM) [REPLY]
Ok how about a turret or drone

💬 [34] dellungi (10:53:26 AM)

💬 [35] ixxcs (10:53:35 AM) [REPLY]
they're same

💬 [36] ixxcs (10:54:04 AM) [REPLY]
drone is too much. besides arduino is too heavy to be used in a drone. turret is cool.

💬 [37] icestonks (10:55:02 AM)
Hey, so I want to create a 'clap detector' to turn off some LED lights, but the only solution i came across, is changing the sensitivity of the microphone, so that it only picks up loud noises. 

I would like something a bit more specific, where you don't have to clap with really high force. Is there really no other solution to detect claps?

💬 [38] .pseud0 (10:55:51 AM)
my advice would be, if you're a beginner beginner, get a cheap Uno R3 start kit, follow through all the tutorials and components in there, then you'll have a better basis for your actual project, or inspiration for it. there are also cheaper and smaller starter kits available than the Elegoo one. But you don't do a lot of stuff with just the Arduino board (any fun stuff).

💬 [39] ixxcs (10:55:58 AM) [REPLY]
keep calculating average sound (noise) during runtime

💬 [40] ixxcs (10:56:24 AM) [REPLY]
he said its too expensive

💬 [41] icestonks (10:56:36 AM) [REPLY]
And what would that exactly do? Can't really see what you mean

💬 [42] .pseud0 (10:57:27 AM)


💬 [43] .pseud0 (10:57:29 AM)
As low as 13€

💬 [44] dellungi (10:57:30 AM) [REPLY]
I can buy the one on Amazon for $40 US

💬 [45] .pseud0 (10:57:37 AM)
well, that's without the microcontroller

💬 [46] .pseud0 (10:58:02 AM)
that's like the bare minimum

💬 [47] .pseud0 (10:58:06 AM)
LEDs, resistors, buttons, one IC

💬 [48] .pseud0 (10:58:08 AM)
andthe board

💬 [49] ixxcs (10:58:53 AM) [REPLY]
sorry i misunderstood the question at first. 
if you want it to react to claps instead of amplitude of sound, you should look up algorithms. for example there are codes available for wake word detection like "alexa", i assume similar ones should be available for detecting claps.

💬 [50] dellungi (10:59:52 AM) [REPLY]
So I get this??

💬 [51] dellungi (10:59:58 AM)
It’s $46

💬 [52] ixxcs (11:00:21 AM) [REPLY]
i personally think you should just search "bluetooth controlled car with arduino" on youtube and order the components in the video.

💬 [53] icestonks (11:00:24 AM) [REPLY]
Is an esp powerful enough to run algorithms ?

💬 [54] .pseud0 (11:00:27 AM) [REPLY]
I'd go for that, yep. even comes with tutorials for all the components.

💬 [55] ixxcs (11:00:45 AM) [REPLY]
yep the wake word ones i saw were made for esp32

💬 [66] dapilot954 (12:39:00 PM)
Yo does anyone know how to detect the amount of current going through a circuit not connected to the arduino.  What I mean is imagine a simple dc circuit with a battery, potentiometer and motor where the potentiometer would control the circuit resistance and consequently motor speed would it then be possible to move a servo using an arduino depending on the current passing through the motor

💬 [67] ixxcs (12:39:25 PM) [REPLY]
bruh first time hearing abt breadboard psu theyre gonna be so helpful. you can use 9V drum jack to power the psu and it conveniently supplies 5v and 3.3v

💬 [68] klevi_ (12:39:29 PM) [REPLY]
So the R3? I agree, the UNO is the best to start with

💬 [69] dapilot954 (12:39:33 PM) [REPLY]
Like is there a module for that or smth

💬 [70] dellungi (12:40:22 PM) [REPLY]
Idk r3 or r4 im a noobie

💬 [71] klevi_ (12:42:17 PM) [REPLY]
I think you have the 2 things mixed up.
1: Use analog read to measure a potenetiometers position and use that value to set the speed of a motor or set the position of a servo

2. Use a shunt resistor to measure the current flowing trough it

So the potmeter could be used for setting both the motor speed and servo. Or just one of them, doesn't matter

💬 [72] klevi_ (12:42:51 PM) [REPLY]
R3 is better for starting out IMO.

💬 [73] dapilot954 (12:44:00 PM) [REPLY]
The thing is the circuit would be seperate from the arduino and do it’s own thing without relying on the arduino

💬 [74] klevi_ (12:44:50 PM)
Most common potmeters are only rated for like 20mA. You can't run a motor trough it

💬 [75] klevi_ (12:47:11 PM)
You can also just do this. You will need a transistor that will take to load and you will control it with the potmeter. https://discord.com/channels/420594746990526466/556594862502182914/1328056111793705005

Probably like around 800 mA

💬 [89] xmax0086 (1:02:34 PM)
my first idea was a simple powerful dc motor (the ones i have have 40 A stall current and are only 1 €) but those will probably start burning when stalled at that voltage/current

💬 [102] xmax0086 (1:07:29 PM)
which is why it should be done outside and in a safe place, plus you need to research exactly which wire is suited at what length for the test but it should work to get your desired current

💬 [105] xmax0086 (1:08:53 PM)
a motor at stall is nothing but a resistive wire anyway, just bunched together causing them to burn their isolation/short

💬 [106] patrick_2144 (1:09:43 PM)
I’ll see which one would be cheaper/easier for me, the resistive wire or transistor

💬 [107] klevi_ (1:10:14 PM) [REPLY]
So. We would use a voltage drop that is detectable by the UNO but not too high. Using ohms law we can calculate that if we want a 0.2V voltage drop that we can measure. 

Resistance:
I = U / R -> R = U / I 
R = 0.2V / 0.8A = 0.25ohms.

Power rating
P = U * I
P = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16W

💬 [110] klevi_ (1:13:30 PM) [REPLY]
At a 0.2V voltage drop using the UNO (5 / 1028 = 0.0048V steps of the ADC) so the voltage drop divided by the steps ~5mV -> 0.2/0.0048 = 41.66 steps.
800mA/41.66 = 19mA per step.

💬 [115] klevi_ (1:16:03 PM) [REPLY]
Using an opamp will also make it more accurate and efficient. The whole point is, that you need to calculate for the consumption that you want to measure.

💬 [116] xmax0086 (1:16:21 PM)
Ohms law R=U/I = 12 V/30 A, then assume you need 1-2 m of wire and determine which resistive wire has R at 2 m length

💬 [117] klevi_ (1:17:11 PM) [REPLY]
A hall effect current sensor is great, efficient, you just need to calculate with the current range

💬 [118] xmax0086 (1:17:31 PM)

hello i have to use interruptor for my program and i was using a delay for the button bouncing ``` if(digitalRead(button) == LOW)
{
 // the thing i want to do 
 delay(200);
}

but now with interruptor it dont work anymore 😦 
someone know something like an anti bouncing (i am looking for a lot of tuto on youtube but i dont find one i understand correctly)

If you add the wattages together they will be as expensive as this. You still need cooling for those resistors to achieve their max rating

hi. my project uses:
esp32, max9814 mic, an oled display, an amplifier, a small speaker, an sd card module.
currently using pc usb port to power esp32. all components use power from esp32. now i want to make it portable so i am planning to use battery.
which battery should i use? how is operating and charging time calculated? 
i currently have a 3.7V 29.6wh 8000mAh battery i extracted from a power bank. is that ok?

💬 [161] penpengu (1:42:52 PM) [REPLY]
SD-cards themselves run on 3.3V.
If you have an Arduino Uno, you need an SD-card reader module that has level shifting and 5V->3.3V regulator.
If you have an ESP32 or other similar MCU with 3.3V logic level you need an SD-card reader that has no level shifting.

💬 [184] penpengu (1:53:09 PM) [REPLY]
that's one with level shifting and 5V->3.3V regulator made for unos. 
If I understand it correctly, then it should still work with an ESP32. Yes, it needs 5V in this case.
But you could switch to a way smaller SD card reader.

💬 [185] penpengu (1:53:18 PM)
smaller micro sd breakout without the unnecessary level shifter and voltage regulator.

💬 [186] ixxcs (1:53:38 PM)
unavailable here

💬 [187] ixxcs (1:54:03 PM) [REPLY]
so why wouldn't it work on 3.3V with esp32?

💬 [188] penpengu (1:56:15 PM) [REPLY]
because of the voltage regulator
The "for 5V MCUs" SD-card readers have a voltage regulator that regulates 5V down to 3.3V for the sd-card. If you supply that voltage regulator with less than 4.8V then I don't know what it outputs. Probably not 3.3V so the Sd-card doesn't work.
Because you have an ESP32 you can use a breakout board that doesn't have the useless voltage regulator and supply the sd-card directly with 3.3V

💬 [189] ixxcs (1:57:24 PM) [REPLY]
i see so it isn't working on 3.3V because its made for arduino's 5V and expects a 5V even tho it could run on 3.3V but the regulator doesn't let it.

💬 [190] penpengu (1:57:41 PM)
yes

💬 [191] ixxcs (1:58:18 PM)
btw how does one calculate operating time of their project?

there are generic alternatives from various companies

💬 [193] penpengu (1:59:06 PM) [REPLY]
I think just trying it out is the easiest way. Unless you're looking at multiple-weeks battery power

💬 [194] ixxcs (1:59:58 PM) [REPLY]
ohk! so looking at the parts here, what else would i need alongside that battery?

💬 [195] penpengu (2:01:13 PM) [REPLY]
this is the easiest option probably

💬 [196] ixxcs (2:01:45 PM)
the battery looks like this

💬 [197] penpengu (2:01:47 PM)
But if you can remove the 5V modules (like use a sd card reader that only needs 3.3V) then you could use a buck-boost to get to only 3.3V

💬 [198] ixxcs (2:02:40 PM) [REPLY]
i dont mind supplying 5V besides i might have to add 5V components in the future too

charging (some have a usb c port), overvoltage undervoltage protection, short protection

💬 [204] xmax0086 (2:12:06 PM)
for >= 2s you need to balance the cells, for 1s you just need to solder/connect 4 wires to the bms

💬 [205] xmax0086 (2:12:28 PM)
battery +/- -> bms battery +/-, load +/- -> bms load +/-

💬 [206] anonengineering (2:31:28 PM) [REPLY]
the slightly dangerous option is bypass the regulator and feed 3.3v to Vcc

💬 [207] ixxcs (2:33:58 PM) [REPLY]
so bms will take care of charging as well? will i be able to plug usb from wall adapter directly to bms to charge the battery? how will i know if its full or the battery is dead?

💬 [208] ixxcs (2:34:51 PM) [REPLY]
no its working well, there's no benefit in tweaking sd module as they tend to be delicate and with no real benefits

💬 [209] xmax0086 (2:45:29 PM) [REPLY]
good question, no idea 😄

💬 [210] xmax0086 (2:45:47 PM)
you can use a charger with a power indicator that will drop to 0 W if it stopped charging

💬 [211] xmax0086 (2:46:04 PM)
i think it will stop supplying current once the voltage is too low

💬 [212] xmax0086 (2:46:38 PM)
so if your device turns off you know it probably dropped below the minimum voltage

yeah you can get those for 20 cent a piece

are you able to display custom text on the screen?  are you able to get readings from the ultrasonic sensor? if not, are you giving them the right voltage? double check all your wiring, do you have an oscilloscope? if so check the signals. if both devices are working individually but not together, that tells you its a simple firmware msitake. investigate whats happening, nothing will ever work straight from chatgpt

Hi everyone,
I’m new to the ESP32 world, and I recently got a LilyGo T-Display S3 Pro board to create a photo viewer that reads images from an SD card.

Initially, I uploaded a simple SD card reading code, and it worked fine. However, after that, the board started showing errors, and now it won’t start at all.

If I try uploading another code, it throws GPIO errors.
If I fix those, it says the T-Display S3 Pro setup is not selected, even though I selected it in the configuration.
I’m stuck and don’t know how to proceed. Any help would be appreciated!

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

Ensured the correct board is selected in the Arduino IDE.
Verified the User_Setup_Select.h file in the TFT_eSPI library to confirm the correct setup is uncommented.
Reinstalled the drivers and libraries.
My Setup:
Board: LilyGo T-Display S3 Pro
IDE: Arduino IDE

💬 [58] ecz_na1 (12:49:53 PM)
im not sure whether if i connected everything correctly

💬 [59] anonengineering (12:50:28 PM)
an Uno, that controls a servo, and has an LCD display & buzzer

💬 [60] ecz_na1 (12:50:46 PM) [REPLY]
yes

💬 [61] ecz_na1 (12:50:57 PM)
heres my idea right

💬 [62] ecz_na1 (12:50:58 PM)
Interactive potentiometer game. The tilt switch controls the status of the entire Arduino, it turns on or off the game. The potentiometer decides the servo's position, and the push button is used to score a point and turn off an LED. The game will function as one of 4 LEDs will light up randomly and we need to position the servo using the potentiometer to point towards the LED that is lit up. When it is positioned correctly we will press the push button, it will play a sound and will display 1 representing a point on the LCD. The score will increment by one every time you score a successful point. If the button is pushed when the servo isn't pointing toward the lit-up LED, Incorrect will be displayed on the same LCD, and the score will reset as a sign of losing the game.

💬 [63] anonengineering (12:51:46 PM)
ok, sounds reasonable

💬 [64] ecz_na1 (12:52:04 PM)
my teacher didn't really teach much, so im unsure if im doing things correctly

💬 [65] anonengineering (12:52:40 PM)
is your LCD parallel or I2C? (parallel is shown above)

💬 [66] ecz_na1 (12:53:31 PM)
its parallel

💬 [67] anonengineering (12:53:38 PM)
the servo moves 180° so your LEDs will need to be in positions it can point to

💬 [68] ecz_na1 (12:53:53 PM)
thats true, i will need to fix that

💬 [69] ecz_na1 (12:53:58 PM)

not really

💬 [72] 04ixn (12:55:23 PM) [REPLY]
this is just push buttons with pull down resistors

💬 [73] anonengineering (12:55:46 PM)
it's an online sim that has all those parts (not the tilt switch, but you can simulate with a pushbutton) try wiring it all up, and add your code. Then folks can go to one place and see where you are at.

💬 [87] shawarma._._. (1:07:09 PM)
i am trying to get a dc motor to only work when a push button is pressed (with a 5s delay) and then the motor should stop when the tilt sensor detects no tilt. it should also be easy to increase the power of the dc motor with a potentiometer. but the dc motor keeps turning on no matter what and will not work with any code i have tried so far, and also it messes up the lcd screen. 

can anybody please advise me with code/if ive wired it wrong

yeah that was a mistake in the diagram but it's been grounded in real life

💬 [102] 04ixn (1:17:59 PM)
thats collector

💬 [103] shawarma._._. (1:18:00 PM)
its just my motor will always start and doesnt turn off or listen to commands

💬 [104] anonengineering (1:18:09 PM)
so if you bring the base resisitor to 5v the motor spins?

💬 [105] anonengineering (1:19:24 PM)
and it stops when grounded?

i purposely spaced everything out so my teacher can understand it easier

💬 [120] 04ixn (1:24:01 PM)
code should work just fine if ur pulling the transistor base high or low or if you are mapping potentiometer analog value to pwm scale 0-255

💬 [127] shawarma._._. (1:35:46 PM) [REPLY]
yeah i understand it is using pwm but whenver i have made it, it always runs the motor regardless and never controls it properly

💬 [128] shawarma._._. (1:35:56 PM)
which would probably mean a code issue

💬 [129] shawarma._._. (1:36:13 PM) [REPLY]
and i am trying to get it to these specifications

💬 [130] 04ixn (1:36:53 PM)
u should initialize the signal pin to low signal

💬 [131] 04ixn (1:37:40 PM)


💬 [132] 04ixn (1:38:00 PM)
heres for pwm

💬 [133] shawarma._._. (1:38:26 PM)
ohhh

💬 [134] 04ixn (1:38:41 PM)
lemme check tinkercad

💬 [135] shawarma._._. (1:39:15 PM)
so for button it would just be digitalread and if button is high, set motor to high?

💬 [136] 04ixn (1:42:17 PM)


💬 [137] 04ixn (1:42:27 PM)
theres the code for push button

💬 [138] shawarma._._. (1:43:26 PM)
oh so my code worked then?

💬 [139] shawarma._._. (1:43:30 PM)
thats brilliant

💬 [140] 04ixn (1:43:33 PM)
no

💬 [141] 04ixn (1:43:36 PM)
i changed it

💬 [142] shawarma._._. (1:43:45 PM)
oh what changes are there

💬 [143] 04ixn (1:43:49 PM)
you put 5 milliseconds in the delay

💬 [144] 04ixn (1:43:59 PM)
i removed  the boolean since it doesnt really do anything

💬 [145] shawarma._._. (1:44:15 PM)
phew i didnt really know how to use bools anyways

💬 [146] 04ixn (1:44:29 PM)
digitalwrite HIGH to turn on motor, add 5000 milliseconds delay, digitalWrite LOW to turn off motor

💬 [147] shawarma._._. (1:45:01 PM)
my next step is to combine this with potentiometer, so it is at a base rpm but increases when i turn the pot

💬 [148] 04ixn (1:45:26 PM)


💬 [149] 04ixn (1:45:32 PM)
whats the working principle on this one

💬 [150] shawarma._._. (1:46:06 PM)
so the toggle switch is an emergency off switch,
i was thinking of using it in an if else statement

💬 [151] shawarma._._. (1:46:31 PM)
the second button will simulate a tilt sensor which i will add in later

💬 [152] shawarma._._. (1:46:48 PM)
when it has tilted, or the button is pressed, that unlocks the first button

💬 [153] shawarma._._. (1:47:07 PM)
you can press the first button, after a 5 sec delay it turns on motor to base speed

💬 [154] shawarma._._. (1:47:15 PM)
you have the option to increase speed with pot

💬 [155] shawarma._._. (1:47:41 PM)
and it has like a 10 second period after which the buzzer sounds

💬 [156] shawarma._._. (1:47:50 PM)
messages will be on the lcd at all times

💬 [157] shawarma._._. (1:48:09 PM)
the LED is just to indicate power is on so will be coded with the killswitch

💬 [158] 04ixn (1:51:15 PM)
so putting switch aside, when second button is pressed (tilted), you can press the first button to turn on motor in base rpm and you can change speed for about 10 seconds before motor automatically turns off and activating buzzer?

💬 [159] shawarma._._. (1:51:55 PM) [REPLY]
yep, just with a 5 sec delay from when u press the button to when it turns on

💬 [160] shawarma._._. (1:52:03 PM)
but you hit the nail on the head

💬 [9] icantopenit (11:55:38 PM)
See the AFMS begin?  I put a serial print just below it to see if it would get past that line

💬 [10] icantopenit (11:55:44 PM)
and it just hangs there.

💬 [11] icantopenit (11:56:23 PM)
here's the guidance for the jumper

💬 [12] icantopenit (11:56:24 PM)
If you would like to have a single DC power supply for the Arduino and motors

Say a wall adapter or a single battery pack with 6-12VDC output, simply plug it into the DC jack on the Arduino or the 2-pin power terminal block on the shield. Place the power jumper on the motor shield.

💬 [13] icantopenit (11:57:08 PM)
😉

💬 [14] icantopenit (11:57:24 PM)
I just don't get why it's hanging on that AFMS begin

💬 [15] icantopenit (11:57:49 PM)
and I'm not experienced enough with arduinos and coding to understand why

💬 [16] icantopenit (12:00:25 AM)
No

💬 [17] icantopenit (12:00:32 AM)
actually looking at this one, it's a bit different

yep

💬 [21] icantopenit (12:03:10 AM)
pulled it off and double checked

V2

💬 [23] icantopenit (12:04:00 AM)
what does that error mean

💬 [24] anonengineering (12:07:22 AM)
i don't see that library in the Arduino V2.x IDE, how did you install the library?

💬 [25] icantopenit (12:07:48 AM)


💬 [26] anonengineering (12:08:31 AM)
yes, just found it

💬 [27] anonengineering (12:09:00 AM)
it's up to V1.1.3

💬 [28] icantopenit (12:09:06 AM)
Odd my version only goes up to 1.0.9

💬 [29] anonengineering (12:09:21 AM)
right lib for V2?

💬 [30] icantopenit (12:09:41 AM)
Pretty sure, it says motor shield V2 library

💬 [31] icantopenit (12:10:43 AM)
Is that the newer IDE you're using?

🎯 [32] anonengineering (12:11:53 AM)
does the shield rub against the USB jack? maybe a piece of paper or a layer of electrical tape in there to prevent shorts

💬 [33] anonengineering (12:12:01 AM)
yes I'm on V2

💬 [34] anonengineering (12:12:22 AM)
but iirc i had it working on V1.8.19

💬 [35] icantopenit (12:12:35 AM)
I pulled it up slightly so they aren't touching

💬 [36] anonengineering (12:13:26 AM)
i found my shield, lemme see what I get

💬 [37] icantopenit (12:13:27 AM)
That code you gave me,...  say from one version of the library to another, would that possibly cause an error like that?

🎯 [38] anonengineering (12:13:57 AM)
i think it's more hardware dependant, V1 / V2 of the shield

💬 [39] icantopenit (12:14:06 AM)
huh

💬 [40] icantopenit (12:14:08 AM)
okay

sounds like you can't test the function's execution like that.

in the example code is this:

are the comments (`//`) missing?

I've got them either on one line or the other for the begin command

💬 [54] icantopenit (12:23:21 AM)
I was just trying the other frequency to see if something happened.

💬 [55] anonengineering (12:23:29 AM)
because it's complaining about the `begin` method

💬 [56] anonengineering (12:24:35 AM)
but on my side there is no problem, (lib version 1.1.3)

💬 [57] icantopenit (12:24:49 AM)
yeah I wonder why I can't get to library 1.1.3

💬 [58] anonengineering (12:25:14 AM)
maybe it only goes to 109 in IDE V1

I can't open IDE V2 for some reason

💬 [61] icantopenit (12:25:35 AM)
it just hangs on the loading screen

💬 [62] anonengineering (12:25:39 AM)
or you need to update your libraries in Library Manager

i never needed to on Win 10 / 11

💬 [74] anonengineering (12:28:36 AM) [REPLY]
but to answer your question, there is some problem with the library throwing that error
what if you open the example that comes with the library you have?

💬 [75] icantopenit (12:30:05 AM)
That's where I was to begin with, it hangs up on that AFMS begin() line

💬 [76] icantopenit (12:30:17 AM)
like it doesn't go any further.

💬 [2] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (2:03:17 PM)
1. Check the Port and Board Selection:
Ensure that the correct board is selected in the Arduino IDE:
Go to Tools > Board > Arduino Uno.
Verify that the correct port is selected:
Go to Tools > Port and select the port associated with your Arduino Uno.

2. Check USB Connection:
Ensure the USB cable is properly connected and not damaged.
Try using a different USB port on your computer or a different cable.

3. Restart the Arduino IDE:
Close and reopen the Arduino IDE to ensure that there are no lingering issues.

4. Reboot Your Computer:
Restart your computer to clear any potential conflicts or issues with the USB driver.

5. Disable Other Programs:
Close other programs that might be using the serial port (e.g., other serial monitor applications).

6. Reset the Arduino Board:
Press the reset button on the Arduino Uno before uploading the sketch.

7. Reinstall USB Drivers:
Reinstall the Arduino USB drivers:
Go to Device Manager (Windows), find the Arduino under Ports (COM & LPT), right-click, and select Update Driver or reinstall the driver from the Arduino IDE installation folder.

8. Check Sketch for Issues:
Ensure that your sketch does not have errors. You can enable verbose output in File > Preferences to get more detailed information on the error.

9. Test with a Simple Sketch:
Upload a simple sketch (like the Blink example) to see if the issue is with your current sketch:
Go to File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink.

10. Reinstall Arduino IDE:
If the issue persists, try reinstalling the Arduino IDE.

try the all of this

also always a good troubleshooting idea to unplug everything; reboot your pc; then open ONLY Arduino IDE, plug ONLY the usb into the board; then try to flash again.

💬 [10] robherc (2:53:35 PM)
Also you can turn on verbose output for compiling & uploading in Preferences...that will give you more descriptive output when errors happen, so you can "narrow down the suspects" much faster.

Anyone done duplicate setups with Wokwi and TinkerCad and gotten different results ?

I have a setup in TinkerCad that works exactly the way I want, and I have duplicated the same setup in Wokwi, but Its giving a different behaviour... Can someone confirm if the internal pullup resistors behave differently in Wokwi's emulation?

💬 [5] robherc (3:09:52 AM) [REPLY]
idk what all tinkercad emulates, but WOKWI is a "logic emulator" only, meaning it emulated the digital functions generally perfectly, but does not really emulate any of the analog V/I/R properties of anything.

🎯 [6] robherc (3:10:46 AM) [REPLY]
looks like a JTAG/SWD programmer (i.e. USB->UART bridge). What are you needing to use it for specifically?

Use it with my wifi module to connect the arduino to the internet

💬 [8] tonko8630 (6:36:11 AM) [REPLY]
Its actually all just digital, but I seem to be getting the opposite behaviour with wokwi
Here are the 2 setups if you are interested - I wouldn't mind a sanity check - maybe I just have some stupid mistake that I am missing...
Correct TinkerCad: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9lRQKs6wZvs-battleship-rnd?sharecode=JZrDN_7I_c7g_j-A4yJPUPM-cBSZgRORNUjXbebFBjw

if youve never done this before its probably a bit easier to use a well supported display that works with a library like https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2, either way i found an example showing the wiring and how to get it running with the used controller https://github.com/crystalfontz/RA6963

thanks for the help, the thing is that i'm developing a project (with 4 friends) for a gym machine and the requirements are a screen of this size. I had a hard time finding such a big screen and thats why i really need to stick to this. It doesn't matter how hard it is to make it work, I just need an initial orientation on what do i need to start making it work

Because adafruit has a bunch of graphic colour TFTs in larger sizes. (Please double check!) but usually their screens are fairly well supported by libraries and have wiring diagrams, etc

using a raspberry pi pico with arduino IDE and im trying to use the Arduino SD.h library. But I need to use custom SPI pins. I've tried doing stuff like SPI.setRX()...etc but that doesnt seem to be working. Any suggestions?

💬 [7] toph2814 (7:38:52 AM) [REPLY]
if you're using Phil's Pico board core then you just set the pins with `SPI.setSCK( usedClockPin );` then simply call `SPI.begin( true );` *(after setting all of your pins to enable hardware SPI; use `SPI1` if you want to set the second channel)*

💬 [8] toph2814 (7:39:39 AM)
a "port expander" is another option to allow you to have more pins for sensors

💬 [9] _stormgaming (7:41:48 AM) [REPLY]

So it is Phil's that I'm using?

🤔 sure you're using the pins that are marked as `SPI0`?

💬 [12] toph2814 (7:44:17 AM)
for hardware SPI to work you have to use the ones listed for the Pico's pinout

💬 [13] _stormgaming (7:44:49 AM) [REPLY]
Yes, I initially wasn't but after that caused the pico to crash I switched to gpio 2, 3, 4, 5 for it and it doesn't crash anymore but still isn't working

💬 [14] _stormgaming (7:45:08 AM) [REPLY]
It is listed in the pinout as SPI0

💬 [15] toph2814 (7:45:46 AM)
share your SPI initialization code here in `codeblocks`

💬 [17] toph2814 (7:46:35 AM)

this will be shown:
```arduino
  // paste your code here:
  if( something ) doThis();
``` ...which makes it easier to read.

💬 [18] _stormgaming (7:46:46 AM) [REPLY]
It's simply just SPI.setTX(), SPI.setRX() with the respective gpio pin numbers

the issue with the screen you linked is whether you can find a pre-made library for Arduino or ESP32... it gets tricky when you use more exotic displays vs ones with a lot of support that folks have already used for years

See the 2 pins on the bottom? You connect to there with your MCU and a pull-up/down resistor to detect the button presses. The same way as any other button

💬 [163] toph2814 (9:22:15 PM) [REPLY]
monochromatic LCDs are fairly rare in the hobby community *(outside of the 16x2 & 20x4 displays powered by Hitachi HD44780 or compatible display driver ICs)*
🤔 the TWW240128A9-A0 display you linked has a 240x128 resolution... have you considered using an e-Paper display instead?
👇 they are a bit more expensive than LCDs but have major advantages when it comes to display readability in ambient light & power consumption *(if that is a concern)*...  this 2.13" *Waveshare*  module *(similar products are commonly used as remotely updatable price tags at large chain supermarkets)*  has a resolution of 250X122 ... *(2.9" 296x128 modules are also common)* ...

💬 [164] toph2814 (9:24:06 PM)
*(btw, these Waveshare ones have a decent amount of documentation & driver support but you need to dig through them & tinker with them since they are not very well organized)*

💬 [165] toph2814 (9:25:08 PM)
yes... that's the drawback of e-Paper/e-Ink displays but there are ways around it with partial updates *(if you don't mind the flickering involved in making the display look crisp)*

💬 [166] toph2814 (9:25:56 PM)
☝️ ghosting occurs if you don't flush the screen *(the necessary flickering when you flip any aassigned black pixel to white & white pixel to black before changing it to the color you want)*

💬 [167] toph2814 (9:28:44 PM)
🤔 it's an opinion.... I've seen them starting to appear on e-Bikes & it looks very clean & much more premium than monochrome LCD screens imo...

💬 [168] toph2814 (9:29:43 PM)
👉 the thing is, since you are making something bespoke & for commercial consumption, I would recommend looking at manufacturers of said displays... so not for the hobby market...

💬 [169] toph2814 (9:30:14 PM)
🤔 I imagine they may even have models that have better refresh rates *(they are getting better if you look at the eBook market)*

💬 [170] toph2814 (9:31:05 PM)
shoot... perhaps someone can help...

💬 [171] toph2814 (9:31:56 PM)
*(btw, support: documentation, driver software, etc ~is the reason why I recommend connecting with manufacturers directly since they will provide all of this to you when you order in bulk)*

🎯 [1] anonengineering (3:44:00 PM)
a "4-20mA" current loop is a fairly common industrial control system method of sending data.
with an additional module like shown here <https://www.instructables.com/Interfacing-4-20mA-Current-Loop-Sensors-With-Ardui/> you can "talk" to the sensor using I2C

💬 [2] anonengineering (3:47:55 PM)
well, the actual resolution you get depends on the sensor... if you are looking for 0.001 psi you may or may not get it 😉

💬 [3] anonengineering (3:49:27 PM)
you can "hang" up to 127 I2C devices on the bus (as long as they have unique addresses)

💬 [4] anonengineering (3:50:23 PM)


💬 [5] anonengineering (3:51:39 PM)
I2C is meant for short wires (4-20mA allows for long wire runs)

💬 [6] anonengineering (3:52:18 PM)
yes

💬 [7] anonengineering (3:54:44 PM)
correct, each device has a Clock (SCL) and a data line (SDA)
only one set of pull up resistors is needed, they might be on the modules already

💬 [8] anonengineering (3:55:48 PM)
SCL and SDA are referred to as a "bus", a set of parallel wires

💬 [9] anonengineering (3:56:33 PM)
good, then you aren't picturing a big vehicle to move ppl 🙂

💬 [10] anonengineering (3:57:20 PM)

💬 [11] anonengineering (3:58:27 PM)
we each have our specialties, haven't played with audio in years...

💬 [12] anonengineering (4:02:58 PM)
yes, was just illustrating that the real question you need to answer isn't directly related to that sensor but rather "how do I connect an Uno to a 4-20mA current loop"

💬 [13] anonengineering (4:04:07 PM)
bear in mind the sensor wants 8v, an Uno can handle max 5v

the tech is in intermodulating & syncing the waveforms to generate audible sound in a controlled area

💬 [67] the.neksodebe (10:33:22 PM) [REPLY]
reworded: the tech is in taking an audio input and a 40 kHz wave going shboom smash and sending it out with a special high frequency speaker

💬 [68] the.neksodebe (10:33:37 PM)
and when it hits an object the wave scatters and demodulates

💬 [69] the.neksodebe (10:33:55 PM)
also i dont get what you mean by controlled area

💬 [70] robherc (10:34:09 PM)
there are reasons why the LRAD used a physically larger panel, rather than a small one with ultrasonic transducers...it just isn't a super-easy project.

💬 [71] the.neksodebe (10:34:34 PM)
well am i trying to make an LRAD?

💬 [72] robherc (10:35:11 PM)
yes

💬 [73] the.neksodebe (10:35:23 PM)
i don't intend for this to be used for crowd and riot control lol

💬 [74] robherc (10:35:35 PM)
...except you're trying to do it with even more "edgy" tech

💬 [75] the.neksodebe (10:36:04 PM) [REPLY]
no, im just making a parametric speaker

💬 [76] robherc (10:36:07 PM) [REPLY]
that's just a matter of power levels. I'm just looking at the technology involved

💬 [77] the.neksodebe (10:36:15 PM)
if you wanna compare it to an LRAD, it's like an LRAD but much weaker

💬 [78] the.neksodebe (10:36:32 PM) [REPLY]
ok

💬 [79] the.neksodebe (10:36:39 PM)
but i see we've steered off the problem im having

💬 [80] the.neksodebe (10:36:51 PM)
my transducers are not making any noise

💬 [81] the.neksodebe (10:36:55 PM)
and idk why

💬 [82] the.neksodebe (10:37:46 PM)
i've tried 12V, 20V, even up to 34V and they're still not making any noise

💬 [83] the.neksodebe (10:37:51 PM)
i've tried 40 kHz, 25 kHz

💬 [84] the.neksodebe (10:38:23 PM) [REPLY]
also fearing they have burned out, i tested on an unused one and it still didnt do anything

💬 [85] robherc (10:39:54 PM) [REPLY]
as anon said...you can't hear ultrasonic frequencies, so you can't readily be sure they aren't making noise

💬 [86] the.neksodebe (10:41:00 PM) [REPLY]
i also tried putting an ultrasonic *receiver* with an LED hooked up to it very close to the transducers but i saw no light, not even dim

💬 [87] robherc (10:41:28 PM)
...but PLEASE don't aim them directly at your ears while overdriving what supposedly is designed to put out over 100dba of sonic energy... kind of like IR/UV lasers, just because a wave is outside the range that your sensory organ(s) can detect/discern does NOT necessarily mean it can't damage them.

💬 [88] robherc (10:42:13 PM) [REPLY]
you would need to hook the microphone to a board that could detect the waveform to see if it is receiving an ultrasonic signal

💬 [89] the.neksodebe (10:43:01 PM) [REPLY]
well i can't make an arduino oscilloscope for this because the sampling rate is too low i think

💬 [90] the.neksodebe (10:43:37 PM)
i have an arduino nano esp32

💬 [91] robherc (10:43:47 PM)
Can you show me a diagram of how your transmitters are connected to whatever you have driving them right now?

💬 [92] robherc (10:44:48 PM)
your nano ESP32 I would expect to be able to ADC-sample at over 40khz...likely over the 200khz to get full Nyquist sampling.

💬 [93] robherc (10:44:58 PM)
let me check the specs on that board...brb.

💬 [94] cravenchicken_right_now (10:53:32 PM) [REPLY]
I didn’t rlly find anything but I provided the QR code if you feel like looking.

here is a simple diagram of my amplification section

💬 [96] robherc (10:57:16 PM) [REPLY]
https://rcelectricparts.com/30A_ESC_L

💬 [97] cravenchicken_right_now (10:57:22 PM) [REPLY]
PWM Signal Frequency: 50 Hz
​
Throttle Control:
1 ms pulse width: Zero throttle
2 ms pulse width: Full throttle

The PWM signal operates on a spectrum between these endpoints, allowing for incremental control of the throttle between 1 ms (zero throttle) and 2 ms (full throttle).

💬 [98] cravenchicken_right_now (10:58:08 PM)
PWM Frequency: 8kHz, 16kHz
 
     19. 8kHz: Output Frequency to the motor. Generally used for inrunner motors with lower pole counts, more power-efficient, causes less Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and is the ESC's default setting.

     20. 16kHz: Output Frequency to the motor. PWM frequency is generally used for outrunner motors because the motor will run smoother and with slightly more power but at the cost of the ESC running hotter causing more Electromagnetic Interference (EMI).

💬 [99] robherc (10:58:10 PM) [REPLY]
ok. then don't use the code I sent earlier...I need to make you a new function for testing.

💬 [100] the.neksodebe (10:58:39 PM) [REPLY]
also @robherc KV5ROB i may have found the [datasheet](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_Ultrasonic_Distance_Sensor-Qwiic/assets/component_documentation/TCT40-16-T-R.pdf)

💬 [101] the.neksodebe (10:58:48 PM)
this looks just like it

💬 [102] cravenchicken_right_now (10:58:58 PM) [REPLY]
Yes if you could write the code and let me learn from it that would be great! And I really appreciate your help.

💬 [103] robherc (10:59:56 PM) [REPLY]
seems likely to be a pretty high-distortion amplifier there, but are all of the speakers connected in parallel to a single frequency generator?

💬 [104] the.neksodebe (11:01:09 PM) [REPLY]
uh yea i suppose so, if by frequency generator you mean the 555 + amplifier

💬 [105] the.neksodebe (11:01:54 PM)
i also have two 30N06L MOSFET's i could use

💬 [106] robherc (11:02:29 PM) [REPLY]
ok, that seems wrong to me. Even the wikipedia article anon linked was talking about heterodyning causing the audible sound, and in order to heterodyne, you absolutely must have 2 different-frequency input signals

💬 [107] the.neksodebe (11:02:52 PM) [REPLY]
so what do you suppose i should do

💬 [108] the.neksodebe (11:03:08 PM)
im pretty sure my 555 setup combines the two frequencies

💬 [109] robherc (11:03:18 PM)
I actually suggested to maverick at the very beginning

💬 [110] robherc (11:04:14 PM) [REPLY]
I'm thinking that combining the frequencies before they leave the speakers & start travelling in the air will defeat the entire purpose

💬 [111] robherc (11:05:03 PM) [REPLY]
have 2 "banks" of ultrasonic speakers. ... 1 bank outputs at 40.000khz, the other at 39.560khz

💬 [112] the.neksodebe (11:05:21 PM) [REPLY]
how does that do anything tho

💬 [113] the.neksodebe (11:05:26 PM)
and where would i input the audio

💬 [114] the.neksodebe (11:05:55 PM)
are u sure ur not just reading off of the  wiki article

💬 [115] robherc (11:06:05 PM)
ideally, you would "checkerboard" speakers from each "bank" with each other, but as long as they're all on the front of your "directed sound device" & pointing the same direction, it should work.

💬 [116] robherc (11:06:49 PM) [REPLY]
yes, because I've designed radio transmitters & receivers that use the same principles with audio & radio waves

💬 [117] the.neksodebe (11:07:12 PM) [REPLY]
i mean ok but where would i input the audio

💬 [118] robherc (11:07:17 PM)
...and because I already suggested this exact solution long before the article was even brought up.

💬 [119] the.neksodebe (11:07:29 PM)
ok

💬 [120] the.neksodebe (11:07:32 PM)
but where do i input the audio

💬 [121] robherc (11:07:39 PM) [REPLY]
for now, we're just making a "test tone"

💬 [122] robherc (11:08:16 PM)
you don't have to "input" anything...just tune the two amplifiers to put out those two slightly different frequencies

💬 [123] the.neksodebe (11:08:33 PM) [REPLY]
are u sure that's a good idea considering it took me like 5 hours to build up and tune the first 555 timer

💬 [124] the.neksodebe (11:08:45 PM)
i'd have to build another one

💬 [125] the.neksodebe (11:09:29 PM)
i think i should first make an arduino oscilloscope to see if maybe the issue doesn't lie in the way im doing it but just with fine-tuning

💬 [126] the.neksodebe (11:10:09 PM)
cause it takes 0.5 KHz to mess up the frequency so much it doesnt play anymore

💬 [127] the.neksodebe (11:10:17 PM)
or i think thats what that means

💬 [128] the.neksodebe (11:10:19 PM)
idk

💬 [129] robherc (11:14:38 PM) [REPLY]
I'm not sure why you used the 555 when your nanoesp32 has a perfectly good DAC

💬 [130] the.neksodebe (11:14:55 PM) [REPLY]
to not use the arduino

💬 [131] the.neksodebe (11:15:17 PM)
i have two of those arduinos

💬 [132] the.neksodebe (11:15:21 PM)
two of them im already using

💬 [133] robherc (11:15:31 PM)
(you'd have to check the esp32s3 datasheet to see if it can run 2 channels simultaneously, but for now you could def. use it for your second channel)

💬 [134] the.neksodebe (11:15:31 PM)
to make the oscilloscope i have to borrow one from a project

💬 [135] robherc (11:16:36 PM) [REPLY]
ahh, I just buy lots...when you have 15+ mcu boards, there are always a couple not currently in use, that you can reassign to a new project.

💬 [143] the.neksodebe (11:26:05 PM)
on the back the pins are labeled and there are multiple with DAC or A in them

💬 [144] the.neksodebe (11:26:25 PM)

💬 [146] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:21:27 AM) [REPLY]
This is why people use the Servo library when using an ESC, because the requirements are essentially the same. @robherc KV5ROB 50 Hz with 1 ms to 2 ms pulse width. You will see the servo library used for this a lot.

💬 [147] robherc (7:22:44 AM) [REPLY]
ok, yeah...I realized that this morning shortly after waking.
...I apparently don't have enough experience with mainstream R/C stuff

💬 [148] cravenchicken_right_now (7:42:44 AM) [REPLY]
I was, but I came here for help and this is what they told me to do

💬 [149] cravenchicken_right_now (7:43:24 AM) [REPLY]
So what do I do💀

💬 [150] robherc (7:50:24 AM) [REPLY]
If you want to use Servo.h for it, you can. Apparently those esc's are programmed to act much like a servo, to be compatible with mainstream remote control equipment.

Unfortunately, if you want to use servo.h for this, I don't have any experience with that lib  or desire to learn it (would rather handle the timings myself), so you may need someone else to help if you don't want to handle the timings manually.

looks like it thought you wanted it to find an AK8963, so it thinks that it failed, since it found none of those.

💬 [5] _redki1ler5275 (9:47:35 AM)
I have the datasheet for the entire kit and its quite large

💬 [6] _redki1ler5275 (9:48:49 AM)

💬 [7] _redki1ler5275 (9:50:10 AM)
How?

💬 [8] _redki1ler5275 (9:50:57 AM) [REPLY]
thats from a different library from someone else

that code isn't included in the datasheet

💬 [10] _redki1ler5275 (9:51:43 AM)
and its meant for a mpu-9250 where in my datasheet it called the sensor a mpu-6050

💬 [11] _redki1ler5275 (9:53:57 AM)
the sensor itself has "MPU-9250/6050" written on it

💬 [12] _redki1ler5275 (9:54:15 AM)
aka "GY-521"

Hello! Need help 🥲 those crossed out are what I didnt follow, but I was wondering where can I insert the water sensor in the arduino board?

💬 [14] penpengu (9:56:46 AM) [REPLY]
is there something written on the actual gyro itself? (the small black square on the PCB)

💬 [15] _redki1ler5275 (9:57:09 AM) [REPLY]
yes

it has "MPU9250/6050" written on it

💬 [17] penpengu (9:57:56 AM) [REPLY]
water sensor is an analog output, right?
So you can use one of the analog input pins A[something]. A4 and A5 are already used by I2C. So you could use A3

💬 [18] penpengu (9:59:08 AM) [REPLY]
that feels weird but I don't have an MPU9250 or 6050 to check

Okioki. Which pin on the water sensor do I use?

💬 [20] penpengu (10:01:39 AM)

The text on the blue PCB doesn't matter.

it found an I2C device. The device identified itself on address 0x68 as a "74" ... do you have a datasheet for your mpu9250? check to see if its WHO_AM_I response is supposed to be "74"

💬 [4] robherc (9:46:42 AM)
from that message you pasted, I think your hardware wiring & your I2C bus are working fine, so now it's just a matter of getting the two boards to "understand each other" now that they're at least both able to "pick up the phone" & "dial the right number"

💬 [5] robherc (9:49:14 AM)
> ...check to see if its WHO_AM_I response is supposed to be "74"

💬 [6] robherc (9:52:57 AM)
ok, you brought up doubts about which chip was actually there, so I was trying to help find a way of expressly identifying it through the messages you shared.

i dont know the board type or any of that

💬 [2] da_waffle_dude (10:40:20 PM)


💬 [3] da_waffle_dude (10:40:26 PM)
i dont know if these help, but they might

💬 [4] anonengineering (10:41:50 PM)


💬 [5] da_waffle_dude (10:42:45 PM)
thank you so much

💬 [6] da_waffle_dude (10:43:00 PM)
also i keep getting a error when i try to upload my code onto the board

💬 [7] da_waffle_dude (10:43:08 PM)
it says it wont upload it

💬 [8] da_waffle_dude (10:43:35 PM)
there are instructions on how to put it together, and i triple check if there right and my friend did put it together right

💬 [9] da_waffle_dude (10:43:42 PM)
so idk why it gives that error

💬 [10] anonengineering (10:44:12 PM)
can you upload to the Uno if you remove the shield?

💬 [11] anonengineering (10:45:11 PM)
not sure if i resemble that remark 🙂

💬 [12] da_waffle_dude (10:45:47 PM)
whats the uno, sorry i dont know anything about this

💬 [13] anonengineering (10:46:31 PM)
the Uno is the board underneath that controls that "shield"

💬 [14] da_waffle_dude (10:47:53 PM)
can i just pull the shield off or is it soldered?

💬 [15] da_waffle_dude (10:48:05 PM)
cause theres a plug going into the uno

💬 [16] da_waffle_dude (10:48:09 PM)
that i upload from

💬 [17] anonengineering (10:48:37 PM)
it plugs onto the Uno. pry it off gently, one side then the other, back and forth

💬 [18] da_waffle_dude (10:48:45 PM)
also heres the instruction, this might help

💬 [19] da_waffle_dude (10:49:40 PM)
i took the shield off, now do i try to just upload the code?

💬 [20] anonengineering (10:51:08 PM)
or just upload the Blink example from File | Examples | Basic, the point is to see if the Uno is working before adding stuff to it

💬 [21] da_waffle_dude (10:53:04 PM)


💬 [22] da_waffle_dude (10:53:08 PM)
it still gives me this error

💬 [23] anonengineering (10:53:36 PM)
are there not messages above that?

💬 [24] anonengineering (10:54:41 PM)
like "not in sync" or "not responding"?

💬 [25] da_waffle_dude (10:54:55 PM)
i dont know why there is chinese

💬 [27] anonengineering (10:56:13 PM)
lol, me either, those are comments so i guess the author is Chinese

💬 [28] da_waffle_dude (10:56:36 PM)
well i think he got it from amazon, chinese company maybe

💬 [29] anonengineering (10:56:47 PM)
ok, the PC needs to "see" the Uno, COM1 is rarely the right port

💬 [30] da_waffle_dude (10:57:00 PM)
?

💬 [31] da_waffle_dude (10:57:04 PM)
what do you mean

💬 [32] anonengineering (10:57:19 PM)
go to Device Manager and look under Ports

💬 [33] da_waffle_dude (10:57:55 PM)
i have com3

💬 [34] anonengineering (10:58:08 PM)
select that in the Arduino IDE

💬 [35] da_waffle_dude (10:58:09 PM)
should it be com2?

💬 [36] anonengineering (10:58:37 PM)
how does COM3 show up? as an Uno, or a CH340?

💬 [37] da_waffle_dude (10:59:18 PM)


💬 [38] da_waffle_dude (10:59:25 PM)
see com3

💬 [39] anonengineering (10:59:54 PM)
good, select COM 3 in the arduino IDE

💬 [40] da_waffle_dude (10:59:54 PM)
also the ide is just the software i run for the arduino, yes?

💬 [41] anonengineering (11:01:07 PM)
the IDE is "Integrated Development Environment", it takes care of a bunch of tasks, code editing and uploading for a few

💬 [42] da_waffle_dude (11:01:48 PM)
so i just get the file path going to the bot?

💬 [43] anonengineering (11:01:55 PM)
since you had COM1 the IDE couldn't "see" the Uno

💬 [44] da_waffle_dude (11:02:10 PM)
how do i do that?

💬 [45] da_waffle_dude (11:02:23 PM)
is it like changing the file path to a usb?

💬 [46] da_waffle_dude (11:02:45 PM)
cause i can start new code segments in different drives

💬 [47] anonengineering (11:03:07 PM)


💬 [48] anonengineering (11:04:03 PM)
you tell the IDE which of 100+ boards you might be using, and what Comm Port it's on

💬 [49] da_waffle_dude (11:04:06 PM)
i found it

💬 [50] da_waffle_dude (11:04:28 PM)
100+ is crazy

💬 [51] da_waffle_dude (11:04:38 PM)
whos gonna have that many lol

💬 [52] anonengineering (11:04:50 PM)
so here just searh Uno and select port 3

💬 [53] da_waffle_dude (11:05:31 PM)
its a little different for me i have to go to tools, then port and select com3

💬 [54] anonengineering (11:05:40 PM)
yes

💬 [55] da_waffle_dude (11:05:56 PM)
also the blink program should make alight blink on the board, yes?

💬 [56] da_waffle_dude (11:06:07 PM)
alr

💬 [57] da_waffle_dude (11:06:09 PM)
it works

💬 [58] anonengineering (11:06:11 PM)
yes, the "L" led

💬 [59] da_waffle_dude (11:06:31 PM)
thank you so much, ive been trying to figure this out for 6 hours

💬 [60] anonengineering (11:06:35 PM)
ok, unpower it, and put the shield back on

💬 [61] anonengineering (11:07:15 PM)
that LED you originally asked about is connected to the Unos L LED

💬 [62] da_waffle_dude (11:07:43 PM)
i see, makes since now

💬 [63] anonengineering (11:07:59 PM)
so, the shield should blink 1/sec

💬 [64] da_waffle_dude (11:08:30 PM)
it has 1 light that blinks really fast, then blinks 2 lights for a second

💬 [65] anonengineering (11:09:11 PM)
not good, can you see the LED on the Uno, is it still blinking 1/sec?

💬 [66] da_waffle_dude (11:11:01 PM)


💬 [67] anonengineering (11:11:33 PM)
you are still running the Blink code right?

💬 [68] da_waffle_dude (11:11:40 PM)
yeah

💬 [69] anonengineering (11:12:17 PM)
then it should still be blinking 1/sec, does it if you remove the shield?

💬 [70] anonengineering (11:13:13 PM)
we're trying to see if the shield, or smth connected to it, is not working

💬 [71] da_waffle_dude (11:13:34 PM)


💬 [72] anonengineering (11:14:38 PM)
so Blink doesn't work now?

💬 [73] da_waffle_dude (11:14:59 PM)
i ran the blink function

💬 [74] da_waffle_dude (11:15:07 PM)
and thats what happened

💬 [75] da_waffle_dude (11:15:15 PM)
idk if thats meant to happen tho

💬 [76] anonengineering (11:15:40 PM)
the LED on far left should blink once a second

💬 [77] toph2814 (11:15:43 PM)
*(sure the Blink sketch was uploaded?)*

💬 [78] da_waffle_dude (11:15:45 PM)
heres the code, chinese included: #include <Wire.h>   
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> //引用I2C库  
  
//设置LCD1602设备地址，这里的地址是0x3F，一般是0x20，或者0x27，具体看模块手册

💬 [79] anonengineering (11:16:04 PM)
```c++
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW

i hope the chinese comments are helpful lol

💬 [82] da_waffle_dude (11:16:45 PM)
hmm

💬 [83] da_waffle_dude (11:16:50 PM)
it says blink

💬 [84] toph2814 (11:16:52 PM)
or

💬 [85] anonengineering (11:16:54 PM)
it's for an LCD display

💬 [86] da_waffle_dude (11:17:20 PM)
i go to examples then basics, then i click blink

💬 [87] da_waffle_dude (11:17:24 PM)
maybe the software

💬 [88] da_waffle_dude (11:17:25 PM)
idk

💬 [89] toph2814 (11:17:45 PM)
or copy-paste the code *AnonEngineering*  gave you above

💬 [90] anonengineering (11:17:49 PM)
just copy & paste what I have above, upload that

💬 [91] da_waffle_dude (11:18:35 PM)


💬 [92] da_waffle_dude (11:19:07 PM)
is it blinking correct?

💬 [93] anonengineering (11:19:08 PM)
ok, ig L is on the right on that clone

💬 [94] anonengineering (11:19:32 PM)
Tx and Rx will flicker when you upload

💬 [95] da_waffle_dude (11:19:59 PM)
do i test it with shield now?

💬 [96] anonengineering (11:20:28 PM)
i couldn't tell from the vide, is one LED blinking once a second?

💬 [97] da_waffle_dude (11:20:37 PM)
yeah

💬 [98] da_waffle_dude (11:20:39 PM)
it is

💬 [99] anonengineering (11:20:48 PM)
ok, back with the shield

"cut the power" is never to be said 🙂

💬 [102] da_waffle_dude (11:21:54 PM)
cutting the power is just a recommendation

💬 [103] toph2814 (11:22:28 PM)
😅 too many a newb has burned themselves & their components for not following proper safety procedures they were not aware of...

💬 [104] anonengineering (11:22:45 PM)

so i have a sensor but idk what kind of sensor it is?

💬 [107] da_waffle_dude (11:24:06 PM)
its the one that looks like 2 eyes

💬 [108] toph2814 (11:24:12 PM)
one thing at a time

💬 [109] anonengineering (11:24:18 PM)
first, does that LED blink 1/sec?

💬 [110] da_waffle_dude (11:24:24 PM)
yeah

💬 [111] da_waffle_dude (11:24:34 PM)
well

💬 [112] anonengineering (11:24:41 PM)
ok, so it's plugged in correctly

💬 [113] da_waffle_dude (11:24:44 PM)
it has multiple blinks in a second

💬 [114] toph2814 (11:24:45 PM)
*(LED on the shield)*

💬 [115] da_waffle_dude (11:25:01 PM)
yes the led on the shield

💬 [116] anonengineering (11:25:27 PM)
this LED

💬 [117] da_waffle_dude (11:25:33 PM)
yeah

💬 [118] da_waffle_dude (11:25:35 PM)
that one

💬 [119] toph2814 (11:25:39 PM)
if the code wasn't changed since last time, it should blink at the same speed as the one on the UNO *(which technically should still be blinking)*

💬 [120] da_waffle_dude (11:26:23 PM)


💬 [121] anonengineering (11:26:58 PM)
b l i n k blink blink b l i n k ?

💬 [122] toph2814 (11:27:07 PM)
very peculiar... *(got a schematic for the shield?)*

💬 [123] da_waffle_dude (11:27:26 PM)
the first and last blink are normal

💬 [124] da_waffle_dude (11:27:34 PM)
cause it blinks every second without the code

💬 [125] anonengineering (11:27:43 PM)
????

💬 [126] anonengineering (11:28:33 PM)
what code, it should (still) be running Blink

💬 [127] da_waffle_dude (11:28:37 PM)
it just blinks like this without uploading the code

💬 [128] da_waffle_dude (11:28:54 PM)
im still running the blink code you sent me

💬 [129] anonengineering (11:28:57 PM)
that is "Blink"

💬 [130] toph2814 (11:29:03 PM)
no... because the UNO is still running the code you last gave it

💬 [131] da_waffle_dude (11:29:22 PM)
oh

💬 [132] da_waffle_dude (11:29:33 PM)
so it runs the most recent code given?

💬 [133] toph2814 (11:29:50 PM)
until you upload new code to it

💬 [134] anonengineering (11:29:50 PM)
we are not at coding that board yet, just want to confirm it blinks

💬 [135] anonengineering (11:30:22 PM)
which it does, so with your code, who knows how it might blink

💬 [136] toph2814 (11:31:26 PM)
btw, last vid shows "correct" behavior... both LEDs *(on UNO & on shield)*  blinking once per second in unison

💬 [137] da_waffle_dude (11:32:10 PM)
do you know what sensor type this is, cause i need to detect a piece of tape when driving then stop on said tape

💬 [138] toph2814 (11:32:20 PM)
ultrasonic sensor

💬 [139] da_waffle_dude (11:32:37 PM)
Its like a distense sensor yes?

💬 [140] toph2814 (11:32:52 PM)
yup... for more info:
📚 https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/

💬 [141] anonengineering (11:33:12 PM)
it's like an audio radar, sends a pulse out, times how long it takes to come back

💬 [142] da_waffle_dude (11:33:39 PM)
thats cool

💬 [143] toph2814 (11:33:43 PM)
*(like a bat's "echo location" ability... or how submarines "see" underwater)*

💬 [144] da_waffle_dude (11:34:22 PM)
so in that case theres no way to detect a piece of tape to stop on i suppose

💬 [145] anonengineering (11:34:44 PM)
for that you use a "line follower"

💬 [146] toph2814 (11:35:14 PM)
if the sound can "bounce" back from it, then the "piece of tape" will be "seen"

💬 [147] toph2814 (11:35:39 PM)

Alr, I just want to know if i have the resources for it

💬 [171] toph2814 (11:58:26 PM) [REPLY]
yes, there are different ways to do it... having just one sensor means that you're only looking at the line itself & can make navigating quickly difficult/impossible

🤓 doing it this way will allow you to understand how each component works... which allows you to modify the robot to do more interesting things than just avoid obstacles or follow lines...

thermostats usually switch AC loads, not DC...so will need an SSR, relay, or at LEAST a triac...not just an optocoupler.

no no, i'm trying to formulate my own issue and question 🤣 😅

💬 [11] innerbushman (9:14:07 AM)
I'm trying to run an OLED display example on my ESP32-C6. I tried an example from this lib: https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306
The example is " SSD1306DrawingDemo".
The error I get is:
```Arduino/libraries/ESP8266_and_ESP32_OLED_driver_for_SSD1306_displays/src/SSD1306Wire.h:84:52: error: 'Wire1' was not declared in this scope; did you mean 'Wire'?```
I tried googling for this and it's a common problem, but pretty much all of the threads are more than 8yo and related to AVRs or whatnot. I couldn't find an answer why would the example not work.

💬 [12] innerbushman (9:14:40 AM)

Random question. How does one upload the bootloader onto an arduino?
After you burn it?

How do you decide what's burnt onto the arduino?

💬 [11] hei.__ (10:17:13 AM)
because I've been looking at these. And, firstly don't know what's right for the arduino uno(assuming atmega328) then I don't know which bootloader gets burnt onto the uno when I would try to burn it

💬 [12] klevi_ (10:18:02 AM) [REPLY]
You can't really tell that easily as far as I know. Probably the one that you choose when you upload sketches

💬 [13] penpengu (10:18:28 AM)
when you buy an arduino then it already has a bootloader on it, you don't have to mess with it

💬 [14] klevi_ (10:18:31 AM) [REPLY]
Back to my first question that you still have not answered. Why do you want to do this?

💬 [15] hei.__ (10:19:25 AM)
Well kinda this thing of the project was reading the sram unitilized right. So that needed to burn the bootloader to make sure the bootloader isn't overwriting the sram. I need to kinda make it workable afterwards. So before I burn it, I wanna make sure I can use it with a usb afterwards

💬 [16] penpengu (10:20:03 AM)
when you mess with the bootloader then you can't upload using USB any more

💬 [17] hei.__ (10:20:50 AM)
So you can't like upload another bootloader after burning it? 😔 or like burning it is uploading it. This is a lil confusing

💬 [18] lumanix_zherium (10:21:13 AM)
hey guys,how can i check these parts to being original?

💬 [19] klevi_ (10:21:17 AM) [REPLY]
You can do it but if something goes wrong, you just lost your board

💬 [20] klevi_ (10:21:43 AM)
And you will need to do SPI programming, for which you need an SPI programmer

💬 [21] penpengu (10:21:52 AM)
Normal uploading over USB basically works like this:
- Reset the microcontroller
- Bootloader starts
- Hey Bootloader! I want to upload a new program, here is it:
- Bootloader programs the program onto the microcontroller.
- bootloader starts your code

💬 [22] penpengu (10:22:02 AM)
No bootloader -> no way to just upload using usb

💬 [34] robherc (12:15:20 PM) [REPLY]
Yes, you *can* burn a "barebones" firmware to your 328P over ICSP that does not include any form of arduino bootloader. ... HOWEVER, as per #code-of-conduct we are not allowed to recommend that you do this, and even without that rule, It is very highly recommended against doing that unless you are ***fully certain*** that it's exactly what you want to do, and you're aware of why.

💬 [35] robherc (12:17:08 PM) [REPLY]
Meanwhile, the good news is that if you learn on your own how to ICSP-flash your custom bootloader-free sketch, you ***should*** learn enough in the process to be able to readily re-flash the arduino bootloader back onto your board using the "Burn Bootloader" option in the IDE.

💬 [1] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (6:35:30 PM)
so it would get the firmware from a server and update from that?

💬 [2] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (6:42:55 PM) [REPLY]
Exactly.

💬 [3] eric9556 (6:54:46 PM)
Each vent will be operated with a servo opening and closing. Speed control on the fans would be appreciated so I can fine tune the airflow. It is possible that I don't need the fans and that they will mess up the way the heater works.

💬 [4] eric9556 (6:59:21 PM)
This is for a solar heating wall. 2 vents are intake and 3 are out. Right now they are manual and they leak badly. So they bleed more heat then they make. I wanted to make my own vents that where better sealed and able to open when the solar heater was making heat and close when it is not so I don't loose heat. Hence the 2 temperature sensors. I wanted a button so I could reverse this in the summer and perhaps use it to cool the house at night. The fans would be to assist airflow but could mess up how effective the heater is so I may need to fine tune them. Fine tuning the vents would also be nice. I still need to build the vents and will need to do some wall work so this is a projects for a few months down the line. But I don't know much about programming or how to make all this work together. I was hoping to start messing with an arduino and doing some little learning projects before jumping into this bigger one.

💬 [5] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:00:15 PM) [REPLY]
Do you already have vents designed to be operated by servos?
It sounds like an Uno would be fine. The Mega would give you more memory and more GPIO but it sounds like you don't need that.

💬 [6] eric9556 (7:01:31 PM)
No, the vents are not designed for servos. I plan on designing and 3D printing my own vents that are designed to be operated by servo and seal better.

💬 [7] eric9556 (7:04:54 PM)
Ok, I was unsure how much gpio either could handle. Especially the i2c bus or serial, dont know either well. So I was unsure if running a little text display to show temperatures, 2 temperature sensors, a servo motor shield or board, 2 separate fan control boards, and a button to switch from heat to cool would be too much or barely anything. Again very new to this so I don't know the limits.

💬 [8] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:05:27 PM)
Ok. You will need a motor driver for the fans to control the speed and a power supply that can handle the load of everything.
An i2c display would take 2 pins. The temperature sensors would likely take 2 pins depending on the type.
The servos need 1 pin each. The fans depend on the method used to drive them.

💬 [9] eric9556 (7:06:53 PM)
I kinda figured that I may need 2 power supplies because voltages seem to be different. Servos and fans I would try to get 5v but I think I saw the arduinos are 7 to 9, would they also work off 5v?

💬 [10] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (7:08:07 PM) [REPLY]
how would i set the server to get the stuff from?

💬 [11] eric9556 (7:09:07 PM) [REPLY]
Wait, so I would not need a servo shield? They can each have their signal pin connected to the arduino and still work ok?

💬 [12] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:11:46 PM) [REPLY]
You will have to set the server up yourself. As to how you would get the file, here is a guide: https://www.teachmemicro.com/update-esp32-firmware-external-web-server/

💬 [13] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:12:12 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah the Arduino itself can send the signals to the servos. They just need a separate supply for power.

💬 [14] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (7:27:03 PM) [REPLY]
i made this https://pastebin.com/DVX8mXTy based on that and it says ```Not enough space for firmware.```

💬 [15] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:45:51 PM) [REPLY]
You might need to choose a different partition table. Not sure if the guide mentions it.
Looks like the guide says to choose the default partition scheme.
The guide has a git repo: https://github.com/rppelayo/webota-esp32/blob/main/WebOTA.ino

💬 [16] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (11:23:24 PM) [REPLY]
i tried that code and it does ```Serial.printf("\nUpdate Success, Total Size: %u\nRebooting...\n", currentLength);``` but then runs the same code again

💬 [17] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (11:25:11 PM)
the whole print ```Update Success, Total Size: 4194304```

💬 [18] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (11:36:07 PM) [REPLY]
i think its a size error or a script error im not sure

🎯 [19] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:02:08 AM) [REPLY]
What is the firmware it is downloading?

💬 [20] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (7:43:21 AM) [REPLY]
```// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World");
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {}```  and then the merged bin file from when you compile it

💬 [21] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (11:33:15 AM) [REPLY]
Have you used OTA previously with success?
I would try another example and see if it works.

💬 [22] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (12:42:38 PM) [REPLY]
only the arduinoOTA via IDE not with the server

💬 [23] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (3:02:49 PM) [REPLY]
Did it work? If so, I would compare the two and try to find why one works and the other does not. They both use the same functions for OTA from `Update.h`.

💬 [24] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (3:26:37 PM) [REPLY]
```#include <ArduinoOTA.h>
#include <WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "your-SSID";
const char* password = "your-PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("\nWiFi Connected");

  ArduinoOTA.begin();
}

void loop() {
  ArduinoOTA.handle();
}``` i used this and just edited it and uploaded it via WiFi

💬 [25] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (3:43:52 PM) [REPLY]
This also uses `Update.h`.

💬 [26] fakemayham_0.8.4_ (3:48:29 PM) [REPLY]
i will look at it but could it be something with this?

💬 [27] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (5:12:53 PM) [REPLY]
No, I think it should work with the default selection.

No, in this specific example, the hardware i2c and spi interfaces on the Atmega328 are only connected to specific pins.
Many other things can use any pins, just these things in particular cannot.
There are microcontrollers that allow you to use any pins you want with the hardware i2c and spi interfaces, the Atmega328 is just not one of them.
You haven't mentioned any of the hardware or libraries you're using, i'm just explaining a situation in which you would not be able to change the pins.

I think there is a thing with counterfeit FTDI chips in which you have to install an older / specific driver.
I will google it, one minute.

🎯 [27] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:41:59 AM)
It may have been bricked by the driver?
Apparently the manufacturer released drivers that intentionally brick counterfeit chips.
I would switch back to the Arduino Uno selection in the IDE since the Nano old bootloader option didn't help anything.
If the chip is counterfeit and was bricked by the driver, i'm not sure what solution there is.

💬 [28] .ak0___ (8:43:36 AM) [REPLY]

💬 [15] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:21:45 AM) [REPLY]
If you open the serial monitor and press the button, is anything printed there?
The bootloader uses 74880 baud rate.

💬 [16] smokxix (8:24:51 AM) [REPLY]
no, nothing is displayed when I click this button, but I can use AT commands

💬 [17] smokxix (8:25:14 AM)


💬 [18] smokxix (8:25:15 AM)
where?

🎯 [19] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:26:41 AM) [REPLY]
The bootloader prints a message at 74880 baud when the board reboots.
So, the serial monitor would need to be at 74880 baud to read it properly.
You should be able to tell if the chip is in download mode based on the message.

💬 [20] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:27:23 AM) [REPLY]
You shouldn't be able to use AT commands with GPIO0 connected to ground.

💬 [24] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:35:39 AM) [REPLY]
Looks like it's not in download mode.
Is GPIO0 one of the pins broken out on the ESP header?
Maybe DIP switch 7 is not doing what it should.

💬 [25] smokxix (8:39:03 AM)
try to turn off dip7 and upload code? GPIO is one of the ESP pins

💬 [27] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:47:18 AM) [REPLY]
I was going to suggest connecting GPIO0 to ground using a wire.

💬 [28] smokxix (8:56:24 AM) [REPLY]
yes, but how do I connect this pin since ESP8266 is soldered in SMD technology without a GPIO0 pin

💬 [29] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:56:58 AM) [REPLY]
That's why I asked "Is GPIO0 one of the pins broken out on the ESP header?"

no it is not moved

@Maverick so ?

💬 [32] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (9:11:42 AM) [REPLY]
I don't know. You have to get it into download mode if you want to program it.
It looks like the DIP switch is not working and they did not give you access to GPIO0.

💬 [33] smokxix (10:12:56 AM) [REPLY]
@Maverick it works! I connected GPIO0 with GND, after 5h of testing the board, damn

why when using this bus without any devices connected the program hangs

I would look at the source code of Wire.endTransmission since that is where it hangs.

generally the same code on a regular Arduino works fine, but on this board it hangs. Using the I2C bus by any command in the program or device, whether it's a display, gyroscope on I2C hangs the entire program. I don't know why, and on a regular Arduino everything works fine.

🎯 [7] klevi_ (1:28:15 PM) [REPLY]
Or just the load is great enough to trigger some protection circuits either in the Arduino or the laptop.  This can damage both of them
- What is the power consumption of your bigger servo? And how much current can USB2.0 and the UNO provide? You will find the problem there 99% sure

💬 [8] makiz.zz (3:46:20 PM) [REPLY]
it works with a smaller one

💬 [9] makiz.zz (3:48:41 PM) [REPLY]
operating voltage says between 4.8-7.2 volts, running current is 500-900 mA (6V). i will series some batteries to make 6 Volts.

💬 [10] klevi_ (3:50:49 PM) [REPLY]
So 500-900mA for normal operation means that on startup it could be several times that amount. That will damage your Arduino and your laptop/PC.

Batteries are a great idea. Take note of their current rating as well

💬 [11] makiz.zz (4:46:18 PM) [REPLY]
laptops have safety features for that, however its weird, it should be able to work

wow, wouldn't it be lovely if that were a true statement! (sorry, most don't have 1/4 of the safety features they should)

💬 [13] klevi_ (4:51:32 PM) [REPLY]
Either that safety system or the Arduino's safety system (poly fuse) made the Arduino reset/lose connection.
- Just because your household electrical circuit has fuses, you don't go poking it with forks, shorting random stuff and electricuting yourself.

🎯 [2] .juan_21. (9:16:50 AM) [REPLY]
Did you connect an external power supply to the shield? If not, it is most likely that you may have damaged the USB port (since USB power overrides the regulator, and you may have likely drawn too much current from the USB port). Try another USB port or computer

💬 [2] patrick_2144 (10:43:29 PM) [REPLY]
Whatever chip that is could be broken, but you will probably have to buy a whole new item because you don’t have the code to program a replacement chip with

Also a tip, arduino is a brand, and they make development boards, but nothing like that. Doesn’t mean we can’t help you here though

It's a 50% Chinese shifter definitely not arduino I just don't want to get a whole new one but I might need to

You could try running the soldering iron over the solder joints around the board to fix them if some have cracked and are no longer connected

💬 [9] art8 (10:51:16 PM) [REPLY]
The light still light up when plugged in, but the chip gets very hot. I have tried multiple cords so that's not the problem, there is a slight chance something is wrong with windows, but I have been using it for 3 months without problems.

💬 [10] patrick_2144 (10:52:20 PM)
Does the whole thing still work though, It just gets hot?

💬 [11] art8 (10:53:20 PM)
Power goes to the shifter, but there is no data, windows doesn't see the shifter or detect it. So it doesn't work

Did something happen to it right before this started happening

💬 [20] robherc (11:29:50 PM) [REPLY]
if the chip (which chip, to be sure?) is getting hot when plugged in & not showing up in device manager at all, you probably are, at a minimum, looking at having to replace & reprogram the chip (NOT a very beginner-friendly outlook, unfortunately)

💬 [28] jeemi (6:19:40 PM)
```ino
const int irLedPin = 3;  

void setup() {
  pinMode(irLedPin, OUTPUT);  
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(irLedPin, HIGH); 
  delay(1000);                  
  digitalWrite(irLedPin, LOW);   
  delay(1000);               }

ty...checking constructor format for that lib now...

💬 [31] robherc (6:22:12 PM) [REPLY]
can you check in your Library Manager in ArduinoIDE to find the version # of your IRremote library please?

💬 [32] jeemi (6:22:49 PM)
4.4.1

🎯 [33] poulet67 (6:22:54 PM)
@robherc KV5ROB fixed it: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/arduino-micro-com-port-disconnected-and-usb-device-not-recognized-solved/167000/4
Trick it to hold the reset button, then release it when the IDE says "Uploading"

💬 [34] jeemi (6:24:09 PM) [REPLY]
ok I just saw that the led works with this code

💬 [35] robherc (6:24:48 PM) [REPLY]
awesome to hear it worked for you!

💬 [36] jeemi (6:25:09 PM) [REPLY]
but when I add some lines to code for reciever to tell me what ir this is, it tells "0x0"

💬 [37] robherc (6:26:04 PM) [REPLY]
are you using a single board to encode, send, receive & decode the signal all at once?

💬 [38] jeemi (6:26:43 PM)
yea, bsc when I was using the other there was some random "?" and squeres

💬 [39] jeemi (6:26:55 PM) [REPLY]
can it be a problem ?

💬 [40] robherc (6:28:28 PM) [REPLY]
likely the send code & receive code are interfering with each other on the board.

💬 [41] robherc (6:29:28 PM) [REPLY]
it will probably be best for continuing troubleshooting to use separate boards for the sender & receiver.

💬 [42] jeemi (6:30:15 PM)
okaay, so wait man I will take another board

Can someone actually help me I know I’m green and my questions are probably obvious but I’m just trying to learn

💬 [7] robherc (6:42:12 PM) [REPLY]
did you pay special attention to the code & wiring from the wokwi he linked?

💬 [8] robherc (6:47:10 PM)
idk, have seen neither your wiring nor your code, so you're the only one who has access to enough information to make comparisons. ... But if it's working in the wokwi (ring/strip makes no difference with neopixels), then either your real-life version doesn't match the wokwi, or you failed to power the neopixel strip from its own power supply (because neopixels suck too much current to safely run more than maybe 3-4 from an arduino board's power).

💬 [9] the_insomniac_pro (6:49:50 PM) [REPLY]
I was using the code from the neopixel library

💬 [10] the_insomniac_pro (6:50:01 PM)
Just the strip test I just wanted to make sure it worked

💬 [11] the_insomniac_pro (6:50:41 PM)
Do you think I just don’t have enough power?

💬 [12] robherc (6:51:21 PM)
yeah, I just always recommend an external power supply for basically everything anymore... the vast majority of the time, new users are having large #s of issues due to not understanding that arduino boards can't be used as "fonts of unlimited power"

💬 [13] the_insomniac_pro (6:52:49 PM)
I thought since it was connected to the computer, I wouldn’t have to worry about an external power. Do you think I should just connect to an external power and the computer?

💬 [14] the_insomniac_pro (6:53:22 PM)
Yeah I was gunna set it up that way but I was at work and didn’t have all my supplies

💬 [15] the_insomniac_pro (6:54:27 PM)
Hopefully it’s just a power issue lol

🎯 [16] robherc (7:14:32 PM) [REPLY]
yes, drawing too much power through an arduino while connected to a computer for usb power puts both the arduino and the computer in the "danger zone" for getting damaged by overcurrent.

plugged it into what? never let 9v touch a pin other than Vin

💬 [18] anonengineering (10:13:31 PM)
but is this not all powered by USB?

💬 [19] anonengineering (10:16:29 PM)
ok, to make it portable you can feed 9v ONLY to Arduino Vin

💬 [20] anonengineering (10:17:21 PM)
does it still work on USB (with no battery)?

💬 [21] anonengineering (10:17:41 PM)
if you applied 9v to a pin you may have fried smth

💬 [22] anonengineering (10:19:54 PM)
but that doesn't tell me what 9v was (or wasn't) connected to

💬 [23] anonengineering (10:20:26 PM)
all those parts want no more than 5v

💬 [24] anonengineering (10:21:09 PM)
the pot is the least likely to be effected

💬 [25] anonengineering (10:21:48 PM)
the LCD, the sensor, the Uno, none of them will tolerate 9v for long (or at all)

real-life, probably...in simulation, you have to add a small parasitic capacitance on one side to keep it from calculating "too balanced" at startup.

yes

💬 [58] kapran (5:25:09 PM)
you can code it

and make it

🎯 [60] madseal1 (5:25:35 PM)
If you can, 
I would appreciate if you could send me references about what hardware I should use and how to wire and code it 🙏

💬 [61] kapran (5:25:59 PM)
you are looking for an PIR sensor

💬 [62] kapran (5:26:16 PM)


💬 [63] kapran (5:26:18 PM)
which looks like this

💬 [64] robherc (5:26:25 PM) [REPLY]
ir tripwire works better than PIR for that

💬 [65] kapran (5:27:14 PM)
PIR tends to fail sometimes also you got a lot of delay*

💬 [66] kapran (5:27:17 PM)
so yea ^

💬 [67] kapran (5:27:50 PM)
you can use either laser tripwire

💬 [68] kapran (5:28:06 PM)
or have the metal part of the door be your tripwire system

💬 [69] robherc (5:28:15 PM)
PIR is also made for monitoring an area for motion...usually a very wide angle. Meanwhile, a laser, or non-laser, IR tripwire is meant for monitoring things like a specific entrance

💬 [70] kapran (5:28:59 PM)


💬 [71] kapran (5:29:03 PM)
^

💬 [72] robherc (5:29:05 PM)
For example, Garage-doors' "safety stops" use an IR laser tripwire system.

💬 [73] madseal1 (5:30:20 PM)
Can I do it using this thing?

💬 [74] kapran (5:30:49 PM)
also as for the MP3 player you need a 2 components
1 that host the music ex (DFPlayer) and a speaker

💬 [75] madseal1 (5:30:49 PM)
I don't have enough wires to link both sides of the door lol

💬 [76] robherc (5:30:53 PM)
sure...still many times less effective & more difficult to use than a simple tripwire

💬 [77] kapran (5:31:10 PM) [REPLY]
you need to set limits

💬 [78] robherc (5:31:20 PM) [REPLY]
that's what mirrors are for 😉

💬 [79] madseal1 (5:31:45 PM) [REPLY]
Don't I need a receiver and transmitter for an IR tripwire?

💬 [80] kapran (5:31:48 PM)
also reflective stuff / even clothing can make the reading a failure

💬 [81] kapran (5:32:01 PM) [REPLY]
there are 2/1 versions

💬 [82] robherc (5:32:19 PM)
one popular type of optical tripwire bounces a beam off a mirror on the other side of the tripwire, back to a receiver right next to the transmitter.

💬 [83] madseal1 (5:32:32 PM) [REPLY]
I was thinking of placing it above the door frame facing down

💬 [84] madseal1 (5:33:33 PM)
So as soon as someone walks past the door, under the motion sensor 
It starts playing the MP3 

Might be easier, no?

💬 [85] robherc (5:34:06 PM)
so then whenever someone walks by, the music plays for nobody?

💬 [86] madseal1 (5:34:29 PM)
No, someone would have to enter the room

💬 [87] madseal1 (5:34:32 PM)
Or exit it

💬 [88] robherc (5:34:42 PM)
think of how many times you've seen an automatic sliding door trigger when it wasn't needed.

💬 [89] robherc (5:34:57 PM)
those use pir motion sensors

💬 [90] madseal1 (5:35:48 PM)
If I place it facing straight down?

💬 [91] robherc (5:36:05 PM)
meanwhile, the "waiting bell" at some department stores, that goes off specifically when you cross the threshold to go into/out of the try-on dressing rooms uses a laser-tripwire that crosses to a reflector on the other side.

💬 [92] robherc (5:36:27 PM) [REPLY]
cut a ball in half

💬 [93] robherc (5:36:51 PM)
the flat-side facing up is how your PIR sensor is now working

💬 [94] robherc (5:37:22 PM)
anyone who walks within a couple meters of a round part still gets sensed.

💬 [95] robherc (5:38:31 PM)
PIR sensors are also FAMOUSLY sensitive to moving sun-beams from windows

💬 [1] sofree._ (3:47:44 PM)
Hey I have a project to make a gait analysis device using arduino and mpu6050 sensors. I need to measure knee angle and also foot angle and foot strike and to validate the device against camera tracking software (SIMI camera) I’m having issues with I2C connections where it would work for a moment and then it would completely stop working for a long time. I tried adding a whoami loop to the code but it only ran once and I could not test.

💬 [2] vilksian (4:11:37 PM) [REPLY]
You're essentially making body sensors, so are the I2C devices a couple feet away from the controller? If so, I know I2C has limits on how far the signal can go on a bus before it becomes unreliable, and is affected by stray capacitance. IIRC faster data transfer is affected by this capacitance more, so in theory, slower I2C communication should be more reliable with these longer distances.

💬 [3] sofree._ (4:55:38 PM) [REPLY]
Whatttttt so if I use slave master connections would that help? I didn’t know about this at all and also if there’s any sources or material I can read to help me with this? Appreciate your help

💬 [4] sofree._ (4:56:40 PM) [REPLY]
They are roughly 40cm away from the sensor placed on the knee and around 80 to the second sensor placed on the shank

💬 [5] vilksian (5:14:59 PM) [REPLY]
I'm not great at explaining how capacitance affects the signal unfortunately (despite knowing what the *result* can look like), but one thing I can suggest is maybe trying to change the I2C clock speed if the libraries your using allow it. See about slowing it down. 
[This stack exchange post](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/106265/maximum-i2c-bus-length) might help you understand it a bit.

💬 [6] vilksian (5:17:23 PM)
I've actually been trying to solve this problem myself for one of my own projects, and haven't figured out a "pretty" solution yet.

💬 [7] sofree._ (5:24:29 PM) [REPLY]
I have 2 weeks to figure it out it’s for my final year project I’m so cooked

💬 [8] _wee_gee_ (5:24:43 PM) [REPLY]
I2C uses pull-up resistors to bring the signal lines "back up" to power, and each device on the line can choose to pull the line "low"

If you have stray capacitances, then this can slow down how fast the pull resistors can bring the line back up to a High logic level, which hard-limits your maximum clock rate.

The distance of the pull resistors to the sensor also dictates this. 
Some pre-made modules have the resistors built in, and can sometimes end up with too many pull resistors making the High "too strong" to pull down for each sensor.

You get an R-C time constant when the line is going from low to high, where R is the pull resistors and C is the stray capacitance.
Here's a link to [Hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/capchg.html) talking about RC time constants and some of the analog world you're going to need to worry about when running wires that long and using I2C

💬 [9] _wee_gee_ (5:25:30 PM)
If this is a final year project then you should (hopefully) have been exposed to Circuits classes which talk about these things, so time to apply that knowledge of impulse response of a circuit!

🎯 [10] _wee_gee_ (5:25:48 PM)
(or, you can just slow the I2C down until it works 'goodenuf')

💬 [11] sofree._ (5:26:46 PM)
I have a previous years code that did this project. I’m expanding on it by adding foot strike and foot angle measurements. Idk how they were able to get results I think they may have lied

💬 [12] _wee_gee_ (5:28:23 PM) [REPLY]
To add to this, you should also make sure that the sensor modules that you're using have a proper "tank" or "decoupling" capacitor to be able to pull the I2C lines low when needed, else they need to "wait" for power to travel down the entire line, slowing edges even worse (or in the worst case, completely starving the sensor of power)

💬 [13] _wee_gee_ (5:28:51 PM) [REPLY]
That's a bold claim to make when you're adding hardware that's so far away and seemingly only now seeing problems

💬 [14] _wee_gee_ (5:29:35 PM) [REPLY]
Especially when there's reasonable explanations such as this for why you're having problems

💬 [15] sofree._ (5:29:46 PM) [REPLY]
My lecturer said they had similar problems and it was a mess up until the end and another person is getting measurements for arm elbow joint and yea he’s using gpt and his results don’t seem to make any sense

Ah okay I’ll try again now

💬 [17] _wee_gee_ (5:32:18 PM) [REPLY]
> he's using gpt
chatGPT is very often less than useless if there's ANY confusion on the part of the human, so that's a worrying sign for the state of the project. 
There's a reason it's a rule in the server that people won't help with chatbot code that no one bothered to write

idk if you have the pull for it but I'd advocate for not using a chatbot to guess at what code should be

does anyone know of a good arduino simulator?

💬 [20] _wee_gee_ (5:33:52 PM) [REPLY]
Wokwi online is good, I've used it and can vouch it's nice for small projects

I've seen people use Tinkercad, but not used it myself. Has a couple extra things like warning you you'll burn out LEDs if you forget a resistor

💬 [21] _wee_gee_ (5:34:45 PM)
There's `avr-sim`, which can connect to `avr-gdb` if you want to JUST simulate code execution and nothing else, unless you write a testbench type thing that mimics your hardware (this applies only to AVR arduinos like Uno R3 and Megas)

💬 [22] vilksian (5:35:39 PM)
I've used tinkercad's simulator thing, and can confirm it works for simple stuff that one might find in an arduino uno beginner kit. If you want to do stuff outside of that though, you're probably better off looking for alternatives, or just doing physical breadboard stuff.

💬 [23] fer_pol (5:36:02 PM)
Thanks!

💬 [24] _wee_gee_ (5:36:22 PM) [REPLY]
If you want to do circuit simulation, Paul Falstad's `circuitJS` online is an exceptional resource

💬 [25] _wee_gee_ (5:36:58 PM)
that's more to analog electronics though, things like current measurement and seeing how much current will go through an LED for a given limiting resistor

💬 [26] fer_pol (5:37:14 PM)
ah

💬 [27] fer_pol (5:37:24 PM)
Thanks so much

💬 [28] vilksian (5:37:56 PM) [REPLY]
There's also LTSpice, if you want to REALLY get into that stuff. I believe it *can* do some digital stuff, but it's not the easiest to get into as a beginner from my experience.

💬 [29] vilksian (5:41:57 PM)
I used it when I was trying to figure out how to make oscillators for a metal detector project, and it worked quite well for that use case. I wasn't able to move past the computer simulation stage of that project, but that's a different issue, lol.

💬 [1] nikkis_blah (10:58:42 AM) [REPLY]
ok,i meant that
on starting the drone up,a resistor connects the arduino to the battery,to make it start at 5 volts
then the arduino starts a pwm signal on one of its 6 pwm pins,that is used as the gate in the dc "step-down"/buck converter,which supplies the arduino with 5 volts from the battery with hopefully less energy losses than the resistor

💬 [2] nikkis_blah (10:58:57 AM)
then the resistor is disconnected

💬 [3] nikkis_blah (10:59:30 AM)
and by that i mean a relay switches it off from a signal from the arduino

💬 [4] robherc (11:25:50 AM) [REPLY]
I would use a 5v LDO-regulator instead of a "resistor" here, and a MOSFET transistor instead of a relay, but your basic premise seems workable.

💬 [5] nikkis_blah (11:34:27 AM) [REPLY]
how would the mosfet be open for the resistor to supply current?it needs voltage on its gate right?

💬 [6] nikkis_blah (11:37:16 AM)
actually,ill just use a push button to turn it on,and release the button when an led that signals the pwm signal is running
since a relay will need constant supply to keep closed if i route the resistor through the "always on" path in the relay

🎯 [7] robherc (11:43:50 AM) [REPLY]
JFETs and some MOSFETs work in "depletion mode" where their default state is "on" ... and pull-up/pull-down resistors to give a regular MOSFET a "default on" state are easy to use as well. ... then the arduino just pulls against the resistor to "switch the MOSFET OFF" once it has the buck converter running stably.

most hardware issues will cause it to not boot, or to reset & "start over" constantly....so if it "freezes", that's most likely some form of infinite loop going on in your code.

💬 [4] fervz (4:35:24 PM)
Im not sure what that means

💬 [5] robherc (4:37:31 PM) [REPLY]
I think @AnonEngineering was saying your switch is turned the wrong direction.

💬 [6] fervz (4:37:42 PM)
oh

💬 [7] fervz (4:37:50 PM)
Im trying to change it anyway to a SPDT

💬 [8] anonengineering (4:39:29 PM)
i would use `INPUT_PULLUP` and wire the center pin to ground, one end or the other to the pin
if the pin is set to `INPUT_PULLUP` it is normally HIGH, until you flip the switch, which pulls the pin LOW

💬 [9] fervz (4:40:28 PM)
Ok so centre to my resistor which flows to ground? one pin to PWM then the other?

💬 [10] anonengineering (4:40:50 PM)
if you use the pullup you don't need a resistor at all

💬 [11] fervz (4:40:58 PM)
Oh

💬 [12] fervz (4:40:59 PM)
Ok

💬 [13] fervz (4:41:37 PM)
So one to ground one to pin and the third does that go to my device?

💬 [14] anonengineering (4:42:20 PM)


💬 [15] anonengineering (4:42:53 PM)
as shown pin 12 is HIGH, if you flip the switch right the pin goes LOW

💬 [16] fervz (4:43:08 PM)
so I dont need to wire the last pin?

💬 [17] anonengineering (4:43:22 PM)
nope

💬 [18] fervz (4:43:40 PM)
and putting that on the breadboard wont change anything as long as it goes to ground

💬 [19] anonengineering (4:44:45 PM)
correct, with the `pinMode(myPin, INPUT_PULLUP);` a resistor in the chip holds the pin high, until you connect it to ground

💬 [20] fervz (4:45:02 PM)
perfect thank you

💬 [21] fervz (4:46:25 PM) [REPLY]
I seem to have a fix about where things actualy go on the breadboard but as long as they get to where they are meatn to go is it fine unless it needs to be in parallel?

💬 [22] anonengineering (4:47:55 PM)


💬 [23] fervz (4:48:18 PM) [REPLY]
For other components though

💬 [24] fervz (4:48:24 PM)
e.g. a potentiometer

💬 [25] fervz (4:48:36 PM)
as long as its connected to 5v ground and A0 it doesnt matter where on the board it is

💬 [26] fervz (4:49:37 PM) [REPLY]
and this will work in both the ON positions?

💬 [27] anonengineering (4:49:37 PM)
the rails top and bottom are continuous (usually) along the whole board
the rows of 5 pins are internally connected
so I could have placed the switch on the far right just as well

💬 [28] fervz (4:50:03 PM)
Ok thanks

💬 [29] anonengineering (4:51:32 PM) [REPLY]


💬 [30] kn8e (4:51:37 PM)
Hi, i'm looking at the arduinoble library in combination with a nano 33 ble, but it looks as no kind of secure pairing is supported (at all?), am i right or am i completely overlooking something in the documentation?

💬 [31] fervz (4:53:47 PM) [REPLY]
Theres no difference between the ground you hhave shown there and the other ground right?

💬 [32] anonengineering (4:54:10 PM)
nope, ground is ground is ground

💬 [33] fervz (4:54:14 PM)
Perfect thanks for all your  help

🎯 [34] anonengineering (4:58:31 PM) [REPLY]
never played with it myself but this example implies you can at least encrypt the data <https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/examples/Peripheral/EncryptedBatteryMonitor/EncryptedBatteryMonitor.ino>

💬 [24] toph2814 (6:43:30 AM)
as mentioned, you need to verify that it's letting current pass through its outputs properly

💬 [25] toph2814 (6:43:48 AM)
*(though the clicking is a good sign)*

💬 [26] mercy_3462 (6:45:02 AM) [REPLY]
so put meter in conitnutuity mode and check betqween the pole and  NC

💬 [27] toph2814 (6:46:46 AM)
`NO`

💬 [28] mercy_3462 (6:46:50 AM)
o

💬 [29] toph2814 (6:47:27 AM)
NC == normally closed *(meaning there will be continuity when the relay is __off__)*

*(as the image I provided above illustrated)*

💬 [31] mercy_3462 (6:48:01 AM)
o

💬 [32] toph2814 (6:48:36 AM)
so when the relay is energized/its coils are powered up, the `NC` to `COM`/"pole" will lose its connection

💬 [33] mercy_3462 (6:48:36 AM)
oooo working

🎯 [34] toph2814 (6:50:24 AM)
be very careful when powering the relay's coils off your Arduino... powering it directly via its GPIO pins is __not recommended__ without additional circuitry to protect your microcontroller board

I wonder why it says 250VAC
I ordered a 5V one

But maybe too late to replace
Been 3 years 🤓

💬 [43] toph2814 (6:55:38 AM)
that's how much it can handle

💬 [44] toph2814 (6:55:57 AM)
based on the datasheets I've found, that specific relay needs 24V for its coil

💬 [45] mercy_3462 (6:56:03 AM) [REPLY]

💬 [46] mercy_3462 (6:56:12 AM)
i see

💬 [47] mercy_3462 (6:56:43 AM)


💬 [48] mercy_3462 (6:56:52 AM)
i also have this thing and it says 12 V on top

💬 [49] mercy_3462 (6:57:01 AM)
so i connect 12 v to the coil pin

💬 [50] mercy_3462 (6:57:05 AM)
and see if it clicks

💬 [51] toph2814 (6:57:07 AM)
it expects 12V power

💬 [52] toph2814 (6:57:30 AM)
with a thermistor to allow you to trigger the relay when a specific temperature is reached

💬 [53] mercy_3462 (6:57:37 AM)
i only have the boost converter that  i use to get 12 v

💬 [54] toph2814 (6:57:50 AM)
*(great for powering a small fan that automatically turns on when it gets too hot)*

yee
i wanna build a water bath w it

💬 [56] toph2814 (6:59:03 AM)
just make sure that the board is rated to the max current your water pump or heater requires *(with a bit of headroom for safety)*

💬 [57] mercy_3462 (6:59:23 AM) [REPLY]
the board has very less current rating 😭

💬 [58] mercy_3462 (6:59:48 AM)


💬 [59] mercy_3462 (7:00:13 AM)
these would be the coil pins right?

💬 [60] mercy_3462 (7:00:43 AM)
would a buck converter be able to trigger the relay

💬 [61] toph2814 (7:00:59 AM) [REPLY]
yes. that rating is for the coil

💬 [62] mercy_3462 (7:01:12 AM)
o

💬 [63] mercy_3462 (7:01:20 AM)
not the entier board?

💬 [64] toph2814 (7:01:42 AM)
the relay itself can handle 20A *(allegedly ~though I wouldn't use it with more than 10A)*

💬 [65] mercy_3462 (7:01:54 AM)
how do i check if the relay works in this particular board

💬 [66] mercy_3462 (7:02:03 AM)
like how i tested the blue one by clciking noise

💬 [67] toph2814 (7:03:22 AM)
you could potentially do the same using a 12V supply... though it would be better to simply power it up as intended

💬 [68] mercy_3462 (7:03:48 AM) [REPLY]
i use the boost converter as i dont have 12 v supply

💬 [69] mercy_3462 (7:03:56 AM)
and cant find the max current in the datasheet

💬 [70] toph2814 (7:04:03 AM)
*(feed 12V to the board then connect the thermistor & set it to a temp ~then just raise the temp with a glass of hot water)*

💬 [71] mercy_3462 (7:04:18 AM)
but i think it isnt enough to trigger it

💬 [72] toph2814 (7:04:32 AM)
a boost converter will be fine since it doesn't need that much current

💬 [73] mercy_3462 (7:04:43 AM) [REPLY]
for relay

💬 [74] mercy_3462 (7:04:44 AM)
?

💬 [75] toph2814 (7:05:34 AM)
yes... if its ratings are to be believed, it's not even pulling 100mA *(most boost converters I know can do 500mA, 1A, 2A, 3A)*

💬 [76] toph2814 (7:05:49 AM)
👉 needless to say, you need to check your specific boost converter's specs

💬 [77] mercy_3462 (7:05:59 AM) [REPLY]
yo where did u find it

💬 [78] mercy_3462 (7:06:09 AM) [REPLY]
foir my temp controller board?

💬 [79] toph2814 (7:06:33 AM)
show us a pic of your boost converter & we may be able to help you find its datasheet

💬 [80] mercy_3462 (7:07:03 AM)
my boost converter is the MT 3808

💬 [81] mercy_3462 (7:07:25 AM)


💬 [82] toph2814 (7:07:47 AM)
this is for your temp control board:
https://components101.com/modules/w1209-temperature-control-switch

💬 [83] mercy_3462 (7:08:43 AM)
so the plan is 
get 9v in the breadboard psu
set it to 5V
connect boost converter and adjust to get 12V out

💬 [84] mercy_3462 (7:09:01 AM)
connect 12V out to temprature controller and then heat the sensor

💬 [85] mercy_3462 (7:09:51 AM)
@Toph sound good?

smol writting on the board

💬 [91] toph2814 (7:10:54 AM)
if your source is lower than your desired output, you need a "`buck`" converter rather than a boost converter

💬 [92] mercy_3462 (7:11:10 AM) [REPLY]
huhh

💬 [93] mercy_3462 (7:11:30 AM)
i use the mt3608 all the time to power up this temp controller and it lights up

💬 [94] toph2814 (7:11:33 AM)
a boost converter increases the input voltage to a higher desired output voltage

💬 [95] mercy_3462 (7:11:38 AM)
🤔

💬 [96] mercy_3462 (7:12:03 AM) [REPLY]
uhh

💬 [97] mercy_3462 (7:12:31 AM) [REPLY]
?

in the next message u said  boost converter increases input v to desired v

💬 [98] toph2814 (7:12:45 AM)
hence the name "boost"

💬 [99] mercy_3462 (7:12:46 AM)
isnt that what i want to do to get 12 v from 5 v source

💬 [100] mercy_3462 (7:13:02 AM)
and hence i use the mt3608 boost converter

💬 [101] toph2814 (7:13:15 AM)
was looking at your "plan" ... about 9V

💬 [102] toph2814 (7:13:34 AM) [REPLY]
this is correct

💬 [103] mercy_3462 (7:14:06 AM) [REPLY]
o

so its the 9V1A adapter that i connect to a breadboard powersupply

the breadboard powersupply gives me 5 v or 3.3 v

💬 [104] toph2814 (7:14:20 AM)
oh... I think I know what you mean.... you're using a 9V power source to power the breadboard power supply/voltage regulator which provides 5V

💬 [105] mercy_3462 (7:14:27 AM)
so i connect the 5v rail to boost converter and increase it to 12 v

💬 [106] mercy_3462 (7:14:49 AM)
and then connect the output of 12v from the module to the temp controller

💬 [107] toph2814 (7:14:57 AM)
kind of a round-about/inefficient way to do it but sure... it 'll work

💬 [108] mercy_3462 (7:15:12 AM) [REPLY]
the 9v adapter dont have pins

💬 [109] mercy_3462 (7:15:15 AM)
its a barrel jack

💬 [110] toph2814 (7:15:43 AM)
you can use a phone charger adapter which gives you 5V already

💬 [111] mercy_3462 (7:15:57 AM) [REPLY]
o

💬 [112] toph2814 (7:16:20 AM)
*(so no need for the breadboard power supply which will only allow you to use 700mA if memory serves)*

💬 [113] mercy_3462 (7:16:30 AM)
or rather i just connect 9v to boost it to 12 v>?

💬 [114] toph2814 (7:16:50 AM)
yes... then use a separate buck converter to get 5V

💬 [115] mercy_3462 (7:17:09 AM)
why i need 5 v?

💬 [116] toph2814 (7:17:39 AM)
I don't know... just assuming you did since you were using the breadboard psu

💬 [117] mercy_3462 (7:17:48 AM) [REPLY]
oo nah

💬 [118] toph2814 (7:17:58 AM)
& this is after all an Arduino discord... so I assumed you needed 5V for the microcontroller

💬 [119] mercy_3462 (7:18:11 AM)
o

💬 [120] mercy_3462 (7:18:30 AM)
yes ill need that later
but now i just wanna test the temp controller 😄

💬 [121] toph2814 (7:18:49 AM)
at any rate, you have your solution.... 
9V adapter ► boost converter ► temp controlled relay board

💬 [122] mercy_3462 (7:19:15 AM)
ye

💬 [123] toph2814 (7:20:18 AM)
you can use one of these *"`barrel jack to 2-pin terminal block adapter`"*

💬 [124] mercy_3462 (7:21:01 AM) [REPLY]
yep i have them but dont have board to attch them

💬 [125] toph2814 (7:21:06 AM)
...to connect your 9V adapter's male barrel jack to your buck converter

💬 [126] toph2814 (7:21:33 AM) [REPLY]
you don't need a board for that

💬 [127] toph2814 (7:24:48 AM)
it all depends on your motors @Deleted User ... the L298N will drop 2V so if you feed it a 3S lithium power source, you will be giving the motor attached to it anywhere from 6V upto as high as 10.6V depending on the battery cells' state of charge

💬 [128] toph2814 (7:25:22 AM)
*(so it will be fine if your motors are rated at 6V-12V DC... but if it's only 3V-6V, you will burn your motors out sooner than later)*

💬 [129] Deleted User (7:32:19 AM) [REPLY]
heres what the seller said

💬 [130] Deleted User (7:32:31 AM)
so i reckon i should probably lower it to 2s then

💬 [131] Deleted User (7:32:40 AM)
what do you think? or is lowering it not necessary

💬 [132] toph2814 (7:45:33 AM) [REPLY]
although motors can work above their rated voltages doing so will burn out their coils sooner than later, shortening its operational life...
👉 so using a 2S lithium battery pack provides from 5.5V to 8.4V, the motor driver's drop will leave you with around 3.5V to 6.4V for your motors which would work fine *(since lithium cells don't stay at their peak/full voltages for very long)*.

💬 [133] toph2814 (7:48:06 AM)
🤓 naturally, if you want more consistent performance from your motors *(rather than dependent on the battery's state of charge)* ... you could always use your 3S or 2S pack & use a buck boost converter to keep it at a constant voltage *(like 5.5V so you're not stressing your motors too much)*

💬 [134] toph2814 (7:50:36 AM)
⚠️ naturally, your converter should be able to handle your expected load & then some as a safety margin... so 4 motors x 350mA each(max) x 20% safety margin == 1.68A *(or a `2A buck boost converter`)*

💬 [135] toph2814 (7:53:25 AM)
it's due to the L298N driver's 2V voltage drop @Deleted User so they'll need to feed it more voltage so that more voltage reaches the motors or use a different motor driver

💬 [136] toph2814 (7:55:16 AM)

Hi, I am trying to run an ESP-01 using a usb charger, I am using a buck converter to convert 5v to 3.3v but it's not working. I am getting 3.3v output from the buck converter but my ESP-01 is not running. All I see is a dim red light for a split second when plugged in.

When running, the ESP-01's voltage drops below 1V, so my guess is that the buck converter is not providing enough current.

What kind of board is it? You might have bricked it and will have to program it with an ICSP programmer.
ATtiny isn't really beginner friendly. The bootloader is not write protected. It also takes up 25% of the available flash memory for program storage. It's really better to just use a programmer.

"bricking it" is accidentally overriding the bootloader?

💬 [13] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:06:01 PM) [REPLY]
It doesn't take much. Any issue during the upload can cause a problem with the bootloader. Selecting the wrong board in the IDE can do it as well. If you need to do something with USB, it would be better to get a board with real native USB suppport. The ATtiny85 does not have that.

🎯 [18] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:14:47 PM) [REPLY]
The list below is for USB HID if that is what you need.
The Arduino Nano ESP32 or other ESP32-S2 or ESP32-S3 boards also.

💬 [19] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (7:29:33 PM) [REPLY]
If you just need something smaller, there are some small rp2040 and esp32-c3 boards. Probably the same size as the digispark attiny85 boards.

💬 [8] toph2814 (1:51:01 PM) [REPLY]
the IR proximity sensor module is designed to use the IR transmitter to send a pulse that goes off ahead of it until it is reflected by an object that is close enough back to the IR receiver....
👉 the receiver's reading is passed to a comparator that signals `HIGH` when it detects a reflected pulse based on the sensitivity set by the onboard potentiometer *(the blue box)*...

Short question, I've ordered an Arduino R3 from Amazon, which is not an official one, but one of the brand 'Miuzei'. I downloaded the IDE from the official site, plugged it in over USB, and it prompted me to install a bunch of drivers. They were from 'Adafruit industries', and a bunch of ones from 'Arduino LLC', where the LLC bit changed with every new driver. Overall it asked me to install 4 different ones I think (1 Adafruit, 3 from Arduino). Is this safe? I'm lowkey paranoid with these types of Chinese hardware 😄

if the drivers are signed by said companies, are they trustworthy? eg: could a Chinese company pretend to be Arduino <Foo> and install malicious drivers?

🎯 [29] toph2814 (2:09:00 PM) [REPLY]
this is why I said *"you can never tell"*  ... there are ways to verify things... remember that you didn't download those drivers from somewhere ... they came with Arduino IDE's installer *(which you downloaded from Arduino's official website)*... so the likelihood of a 3rd party injecting their malware is fairly small

💬 [30] mevrouwbaktaart (2:10:12 PM) [REPLY]
I thought they came from Microsoft, it asked to install them after plugging in the Arduino, not when installing the IDE (I think)

Not kidding mate, I thought it was because I was using Wifi so i uploaded another code which uses Wifi and esp32 cooled down using that code. Troubleshooting led me to conclude the code I sent is overheating my esp32

💬 [6] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (9:47:39 PM) [REPLY]
The voltage regulator was probably damaged and can no longer provide the current needed for WiFi without issues. It's not the code, it's the current draw.

💬 [7] arvincible (9:48:56 PM) [REPLY]
but in both tests i did the esp32 has nothing connected to the pins, it is just running while connected to my computer via usb

🎯 [8] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (9:50:13 PM) [REPLY]
The ESP32 microcontroller on the dev board is drawing current from the voltage regulator on the board that supplies it's power. It draws a lot of current when using WiFi.
This regulator is also connected to the 3.3v pin which you previously had connected to the audio amplifier which was probably drawing enough current in combination with the ESP32 to damage the regulator or something else on the board.

💬 [9] arvincible (9:53:48 PM) [REPLY]
ah shit man this board is brand new😭  Alright I will buy another board. Thank you for the time I will connect the audio amp to 5v or external power source next time

So I tried with the 5v pin and external power supply and 2 different esps and I still get the ssme result where the code just heats up the esp32, I ran other codes that have wifi involved and it doesnt get hot

💬 [11] arvincible (3:37:13 AM) [REPLY]
okay I think i solved it, after hours and different esps and power supplies. I just changed the pin numbers of DOUT, BCLK, LRC and the heating problem stopped... I dont know how or why that worked but if anyone has an explaination pls go ahead

Hi, I am having a weird problem with my ESP-01. It has a buzzer and a button; the buzzer turns on for one second when the button is pressed.

I have seen multiple cases of parasitic powering due to a voltage being present on the microcontroller's I/O pins, which in turn have a I/O protection diode connected between them and e.g. 5V. And hence, voltage can leak in to the voltage net of the microcontroller's supply voltage.

⚠️ just be sure that the 3.3V power you're provided is properly regulated if you're feeding it to your microcontroller directly...

💬 [4] .damien_ (8:51:25 AM) [REPLY]
I am powering it with a voltage step down from 7.4v to 3.3v

💬 [5] .damien_ (8:51:38 AM)
Via the vin and ground pin

💬 [6] toph2814 (9:11:19 AM) [REPLY]
looks like you're good to go since your 2S lithium battery pack will swing from <6V to 8.4V... so all good...

💬 [7] .damien_ (9:15:04 AM)
Interesting so it's most efficient at 4.5v ty for the info

💬 [8] toph2814 (9:16:12 AM)
😅 yeah, rewrote what I told you since I realized you were working with a 2S battery... so you'll be in the "efficient range".... actually at 4-4.5V the current available will still be minimal

💬 [9] .damien_ (9:16:32 AM) [REPLY]
Should I even bother use the voltage step down converter or go directly from 2S battery to it?

💬 [10] toph2814 (9:17:03 AM)
I'd just feed it directly @Damien Staebler to be in the sweet spot

🎯 [11] toph2814 (9:17:39 AM)
*(naturally it would be a good idea to have some protection circuitry to prevent your system from overdischarging your battery pack)*

💬 [12] .damien_ (9:18:09 AM)
Doesn't battery has its own bms?

💬 [13] toph2814 (9:18:18 AM)
depends on the pack

🎯 [14] .damien_ (9:18:36 AM)
Gotcha. So how can I protect my system?

💬 [15] toph2814 (9:22:08 AM)
*(if yours has an extra set of wires for charging like pictured below, then you're good... otherwise you'll need a protection circuit to cut power from the battery when it falls below 🪫6V or 5.5V ~it's more to keep your batteries healthy)*

💬 [16] toph2814 (9:24:38 AM)
then it is likely to have a BMS *(I think)*

💬 [17] toph2814 (9:26:37 AM)
unfortunately too many manufacturers want you to keep buying battery packs when they die on you so you never know if they have proper protection circuitry without testing/monitoring it during operation

💬 [1] goxter.svg (7:25:05 PM)
Hiii, I have a problem regarding the description of my Arduino Uno R3, from three computers, only one computer recognizes it well. The other ones say:  "Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Failed)" Error Code 43. In the driver section they say: Microsoft 6/21/2006 10.0.19041.4474 Microsoft Windows, instead of the ArduinoLLC that shows the good laptop.

The thing is that I was following the "Flash the USB-to-serial firmware for Uno rev3 (for windows)" but after choosing the chip Atmega16u2, the hex file and pressing the usb option it gave me ANOTHER ERROR. "AtLibUsbDfu.dll not found" please help, I´m new to this :c

💬 [2] _wee_gee_ (7:44:48 PM) [REPLY]
This sounds like you haven't gotten the drivers installed right for re-flashing the 16u2 chip; Are you 100% sure that the usb-serial bridge chip on your Uno is a 16u2 and not an 8u2?

To repeat myself, the second error reads to me as an installation error (maybe not restarting after installing something, or not installing as administrator?)

💬 [3] _wee_gee_ (7:48:43 PM)
The question I'd have though is why you were reflashing the USB-serial chip if it worked on one of your machines?

💬 [4] goxter.svg (8:22:25 PM) [REPLY]
yessir

💬 [5] goxter.svg (8:23:46 PM) [REPLY]
The machine that recongizes it. it´s from my mother,  I´ve already tried an infinity of things to fix it in at least another machine

💬 [6] goxter.svg (8:24:08 PM)
so this is like my last resort

💬 [7] _wee_gee_ (8:59:43 PM)
Have you been able to try another OS?
I'm fairly sure there's an ArduinoIDE install for most Linux distros, which can also be "tried" on a thumbdrive in LiveCD mode

💬 [8] _wee_gee_ (9:00:16 PM)
Plonk something like that on a thumbstick, install the Arduino IDE, and see if you can get it to recognize the Arduino

💬 [9] _wee_gee_ (9:00:23 PM)
if that doesn't work, then there's some mega hardware issue

💬 [10] _wee_gee_ (9:00:30 PM)
Reinstalling windows is also always an option

💬 [11] _wee_gee_ (9:01:21 PM)
if the board is recognized by any computers at all, then the board is probably OK; it's probably a driver or OS issue on the ones that don't recognize it

🎯 [12] _wee_gee_ (9:02:26 PM)
Now, I'm making a lot of assumptions here:
-That these are genuine Arduino Uno R3s (not clones!)
-That the computers being used are Windows computers
-that the device enumeration error is coming up for the Arduinos and not some other random device

💬 [13] diamonddback (9:13:14 PM) [REPLY]
along with what weegee stated, by your own tests/finding, its kindaclear its NOT a board issue, mor like an os issue.

💬 [14] goxter.svg (9:24:11 PM) [REPLY]
Just with the origininal windows and a sub-version

I will try to make the linux thing, tysm.
I did reinstalled windows
-Presumably yes.
-Yes.
-Yes.

💬 [15] goxter.svg (9:24:42 PM) [REPLY]
ok ok, I will try the linux fix and tell my results brb

just also make sure it works with other values being low, like minutes and hours

💬 [2] _wee_gee_ (10:34:52 PM)
I'm guessing that at `10:00:00` you'll have a rude surprise as-written

💬 [3] _wee_gee_ (10:39:40 PM)
It's an `snprintf` call with a format spec for 2-digit numbers with leading zeros

💬 [4] _wee_gee_ (10:42:13 PM)
It lets you "print" things to a string first, *then* output them to whatever

💬 [5] _wee_gee_ (10:42:28 PM)
Technically you could also write the format spec so that the hours digit has a leading space, a `' '` instead of a `'0'`

💬 [6] bancatdev (12:02:40 AM)
I do feel like I have a faulty Arduino Nano bcz I tried to press the reset button and yet TX/RX didn't even blink, also, the blink test turned out to be an error, another thing is that even the tinygpsplus test code also turned into an error, so yeah I'm thinking that it is the Arduino Nano's fault

💬 [7] anonengineering (12:03:35 AM)
if all you have connected is the USB cable, and it won't run Blink, maybe so

💬 [8] anonengineering (12:04:06 AM)
but the module needs to have the header pins or wires soldered to it

💬 [9] bancatdev (12:05:58 AM)
I have both the Arduino Nano and Neo6m attached, as I was testing the Neo6m's blinking pattern and it turns out that maybe the Arduino Nano is the problem all along

💬 [10] anonengineering (12:06:29 AM)
disconnect everything, can you make it run Blink?

💬 [11] bancatdev (12:07:45 AM)
like remove the Neo6m from the Nano and just test Nano for now?

💬 [12] anonengineering (12:07:52 AM)
exactly

💬 [13] bancatdev (12:08:03 AM)
alright I'll try

💬 [14] bancatdev (12:12:22 AM) [REPLY]
yep, blinking test failed/error and even pressing the reset button is no use (no changes to TX/RX) (no blink)

💬 [15] anonengineering (12:13:21 AM)
that's a bad sign, and no point in adding more stuff until you get the board to work all by itself

💬 [16] toph2814 (12:14:11 AM)
🤔 __data__ USB cable? IDE errors during upload?

💬 [17] bancatdev (12:15:14 AM) [REPLY]
yes, both blinking test and tinygpsplus test turned into errors, it kept saying "programmer is not responding"
"not in sync" 
"error"

💬 [18] anonengineering (12:15:48 AM)
which you'll get if you are using a "charge only" USB cable

💬 [19] bancatdev (12:16:28 AM) [REPLY]
I tried searching, is it related to the bootloader at all or not? just curious

💬 [20] anonengineering (12:16:41 AM)
probably not

💬 [21] bancatdev (12:16:54 AM) [REPLY]
like connecting the usb port into a laptop?

💬 [22] anonengineering (12:17:13 AM)
yes, some cables don't pass data

💬 [23] anonengineering (12:17:31 AM)
they are good for charging your phone...

💬 [24] bancatdev (12:18:00 AM)
ohh so it might not be the Nano's fault but the cable?

💬 [25] anonengineering (12:18:32 AM)
or a bad driver, could be a few things when you get "not in sync"

💬 [26] toph2814 (12:18:34 AM)
1. make sure you are directly connected to the PC/laptop, not via a USB HUB;
2. verify you have a data USB cable;
3. try using `Old Bootloader` option IDE: Tools → Processor → (Old Bootloader) to see if it will upload;

💬 [27] bancatdev (12:19:09 AM) [REPLY]
I tried 3 but yeah I guess like Anon said, it might be the usb cable's fault

💬 [28] toph2814 (12:19:41 AM)
that's why I brought it up... it's a common issue with microUSB cables...
*(one test for proper data cable + correct driver is to check your `Device Manager` to see if the NANO exists under "Ports")*

💬 [29] bancatdev (12:20:15 AM)
so I'm leaning towards the point that my Nano is not working (no blinks during reset, too many errors) due to my usb cable

💬 [30] bancatdev (12:20:23 AM) [REPLY]
ohhh I see

💬 [31] bancatdev (12:21:48 AM) [REPLY]
yeah I don't see the Nano in the ports, instead I see COM5 CH340, which I don't know what it is

💬 [32] anonengineering (12:21:52 AM)
if yiu are on Windows open up Device Manager

💬 [33] anonengineering (12:22:11 AM)
ah, CH340 is the driver for your board

💬 [34] anonengineering (12:22:47 AM)
does it show an error there?

💬 [35] bancatdev (12:23:06 AM) [REPLY]
I heard that CH340 is common for "clones" ??

💬 [36] anonengineering (12:23:12 AM)
yes

💬 [37] was_ted (12:23:13 AM)
you got a clone board

💬 [38] bancatdev (12:23:26 AM)
ohhh I was scammed?

💬 [39] toph2814 (12:23:31 AM)
yup.. then you have a proper data cable *(since your O/S can "see" it)*

💬 [40] anonengineering (12:23:40 AM)
not necessarily

💬 [41] toph2814 (12:23:44 AM)
not necessarily scammed... you do get what you paid for

🎯 [42] toph2814 (12:24:13 AM)
clones == copies based on the documentation Arduino released to the public

if you paid full price and it was advertised as a genuine board, yes

💬 [44] toph2814 (12:24:47 AM)
knockoffs/fakes == inferior copies that try to look like Arduinos to fool people into thinking they'll be getting the real deal...

💬 [45] bancatdev (12:25:17 AM)
it's like this

💬 [47] toph2814 (12:25:28 AM)
that's fine

💬 [48] anonengineering (12:25:33 AM)
so it is a "data cable"

💬 [49] toph2814 (12:25:51 AM)

💬 [1] zachlovescars (2:01:46 PM)
anybody know how to program chinese knock off arduino nanos based on atmega168pa it's been driving me nuts

💬 [2] .pseud0 (2:09:45 PM) [REPLY]
what's the error message and your Arduino IDE -> Tools settings?

💬 [3] toph2814 (2:10:53 PM)
typically it'll be the same as the microcontroller board it's copying... with the caveat that you need to install a driver for the O/S to see it & the IDE to communicate with it properly @Zachary

💬 [4] zachlovescars (2:15:43 PM) [REPLY]
it just gets stuck until the connection times out

💬 [5] zachlovescars (2:16:34 PM) [REPLY]
yeah i know, my other boards flash fine

💬 [6] toph2814 (2:17:12 PM)
🤨 how is it "flashing fine" if it times out?

💬 [7] zachlovescars (2:17:31 PM) [REPLY]
my other boards, like my mega flash fine

💬 [8] zachlovescars (2:18:00 PM)

are you using it as a programmer?

💬 [20] .pseud0 (2:24:40 PM)
Why not program it via the regular COM port

💬 [21] zachlovescars (2:25:19 PM)
i tried programming it with a mega i have as an isp

💬 [22] zachlovescars (2:25:27 PM)
that's what the wires were for

💬 [23] .pseud0 (2:26:02 PM)
Those cables don't really look attached, did you solder the ICSP ehader at all?

💬 [24] .pseud0 (2:26:13 PM)
And why did programming it via the regular USB port not work?

💬 [25] zachlovescars (2:26:19 PM)
those are old and a few fell off.

💬 [26] zachlovescars (2:26:31 PM)
and the usb keeps erroring out

🎯 [27] .pseud0 (2:27:09 PM)
With what error? Please, remove the ICSP cables and only try with the regular USB port, and show which exact error you're having, at which exact Arduino IDE -> Tools settings, and with which exact Tools -> Port setting.

And what under Arduino IDE -> Tools -> Processor?

💬 [42] zachlovescars (2:37:02 PM)
i tried all 3, none worked

💬 [43] zachlovescars (2:37:20 PM)
the actual cpu is atmega168pa

💬 [44] .pseud0 (2:37:24 PM)
It 100% reads ATMega128 on this chip?

💬 [45] zachlovescars (2:37:39 PM)
168, and yes

it was com5 all the time

💬 [51] .pseud0 (2:39:59 PM)
And the wires are now **disconnected** from the ICSP port? And it doesn't work with Processor -> ATMega168 selected?

💬 [52] zachlovescars (2:40:00 PM)
still it won't flash

💬 [53] zachlovescars (2:40:09 PM)
yes, disconnected

💬 [54] .pseud0 (2:40:24 PM) [REPLY]
Is this on Windows 10 or 11?

💬 [55] zachlovescars (2:40:30 PM)

💬 [56] .pseud0 (2:40:56 PM)
Did you at any point erase the bootloader via ICSP programming?

💬 [57] zachlovescars (2:41:11 PM)
no, never done that.

💬 [58] zachlovescars (2:41:26 PM)
i only tried sketch uploading

💬 [59] .pseud0 (2:41:29 PM)
What is the error message when you chose "ATMega328P (New Bootloader)?

💬 [60] zachlovescars (2:41:36 PM)
same

💬 [61] zachlovescars (2:41:45 PM)
same error no matter

💬 [62] .pseud0 (2:42:08 PM)
Then either there's no bootloader on that ATMega168 or your CH340 drivers are bad

💬 [63] .pseud0 (2:42:24 PM)
first, try installing the known good driver from <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all#drivers-if-you-need-them> for the CH340

💬 [64] zachlovescars (2:42:39 PM)

💬 [65] zachlovescars (2:43:24 PM)
now l led is glowing for some reason

💬 [66] zachlovescars (2:43:34 PM)
nothing else changed tho

💬 [67] .pseud0 (2:44:21 PM)
The PWR LED is glowing, decreasing and increasing in intensity?

💬 [68] zachlovescars (2:45:04 PM)
pwr led on constantly, but l led turned on for some reason

💬 [69] .pseud0 (2:45:43 PM)
the LED on D13 should only be able to be turned on from the microcontroller itself.. which is also SCLK on the ICSP port.

💬 [70] zachlovescars (2:46:46 PM)
i meant the onboard l led

> The lithium battery protection IC datasheet say, it will cut-off around 2.8v, I think if I use 8Mhz clock I still in safe zone.
@F8R be sure to take into account what Toph said in the message I replied to. You need to account for every other chip on the board that'll be getting this low voltage

💬 [4] _wee_gee_ (4:16:25 AM)
For a nano, that's the regulators and the serial chip

definitely handy to have in case you need it

💬 [9] _wee_gee_ (4:22:49 AM) [REPLY]
wow this' been around a while.
There's some serious link rot happening though, which is sad to see. The "Secret Arduino Voltmeter" page (wayback'd) links to 2 pages as where they learned from, which are both dead (even with wayback)

yup... it's sad when it happens to good resources... 😓

💬 [11] toph2814 (4:24:53 AM)
that doesn't make sense... GPIO pins will have a voltage threshold that will be considered `HIGH`... *(unless that's what you meant)*

💬 [12] _wee_gee_ (4:25:21 AM)
yeah, the datasheet states it in the electrical characteristics (but this is only for digital signals that don't use the ADC)

💬 [13] _wee_gee_ (4:25:53 AM)
maybe IO port characteristics actually

💬 [14] toph2814 (4:26:19 AM)
*(if so, the board/microcontroller's datasheet will specify that... >3V on classic Arduino boards ~~if memory serves~~)*

looks like 0.6 of VCC is "the lowest voltage guaranteed to read as high" for 2.7 to 5.5V

💬 [17] .f8r (4:29:13 AM) [REPLY]
Ah, that clear all my confusion, thanks!

💬 [18] .f8r (4:30:08 AM)
That also in line with why 3v consider high in my Arduino Nano.

Hello, I would like to make a motor controlled by a potentiometer so that it can be turned on by a button and changed direction by another button. I succeeded in doing this, but I wanted to add the fact of using an IR remote control and an IR receiver to turn it on (button 1), turn it off (button 2), and change direction (3 and 4). To turn it on, it works, but after turning it on, it doesn't work anymore and the receiver flashes as if it were receiving a signal.

does it still blink if you throw away the IR remote far away so the signals don't reach?

💬 [10] .pseud0 (7:45:48 AM)
it might be a power reset problem the moment the motor is switched on.

💬 [11] .pseud0 (7:46:31 AM) [REPLY]
why, an Arduino only has like 5V or 3.3V of output voltage capability?

💬 [12] .pseud0 (7:46:47 AM)
it's not about the input power supply range, it's about the drive capability of the chip

🎯 [13] .pseud0 (7:47:48 AM)
e.g., this chip can **sink** 16mA max, but only source 0.4mA.

💬 [14] .pseud0 (7:48:31 AM)
so, an inverted LED setup where, the output of the logic gate goes to the negative side of the LED, with the other side of the LED being connected to e.g. +5V throug a 1 kohm resistor, works better, because it can sink currrent better than it can source

if your buttons connect the input of the logic gate to +5V when pressed, then you need a pull-down resistor on the input gate to prevent the floating (undefined) input voltage when the button is **not** pressed

💬 [23] .pseud0 (9:29:37 AM)
e.g., 10 kOhm between each logic gate input and GND.

💬 [1] raptor7192 (8:14:13 AM)
what frequency is arduino pwm?

💬 [2] raptor7192 (8:14:32 AM)
also is it possible to change the frequency instead of the duty cycle?

💬 [3] diamonddback (8:20:05 AM)
It can be used, but its very bad practice.

💬 [4] diamonddback (8:20:41 AM) [REPLY]
what board?

💬 [5] diamonddback (8:21:12 AM)
400hz and on 2 pins 900 hz.

💬 [6] diamonddback (8:21:58 AM)
You can but I highely discurage it. if you dont know what your doing you have a high probibility of bricking your arduino.

💬 [7] raptor7192 (8:27:10 AM) [REPLY]
do you know any resources detailing how it can be done?

💬 [8] diamonddback (8:30:21 AM)
ok but when you kill your board, dont say you was not warned. and there sill be nothing we can do to helo

🎯 [9] raptor7192 (8:31:37 AM) [REPLY]
k, imma use an old arduino with fried usb to serial converter that's alrdy a pain to use, so if destroyed no loss

💬 [10] raptor7192 (8:31:55 AM) [REPLY]
and with you too

@Chris SaltPrairiePhotography, remember that Arduino boards are meant to control components & read from sensors... they are __not meant__ to supply any significant amount of power since they are not designed for that.
👉 pulling more current from something like the 3.3V pin will potentially strain the Every's internal regulator... your best reference is the official schematic diagram:
📚 https://content.arduino.cc/assets/NANOEveryV3.0_sch.pdf

🎯 [2] toph2814 (11:19:10 AM)
which tells you that it uses the AP2112-3.3 regulator IC...
📚 https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/AP2112.pdf

💬 [3] toph2814 (11:19:32 AM)
*(which in turn tells you how much current you can safely pull off it)*

🎯 [1] toph2814 (5:50:33 AM)
🤔 it's also likely that @N0t_c00l_n00b accidentally shorted the UNO's voltage regulator & fried it *(strange that the board is still getting power though)*...

💬 [2] toph2814 (5:51:09 AM)
🤦 also, those male header pins are not soldered onto those pads so it's not likely to have a reliable connection to the breadboard...

💬 [3] n0t_c00l_n00b_ (6:37:17 AM) [REPLY]
Oh crap

💬 [1] dapoliceisoncrack (12:23:42 PM)
running an arduino on a 3s lipo is fine right

💬 [2] toph2814 (12:41:19 PM) [REPLY]
yes, if fed into the Arduino UNO/MEGA or classic NANO's`VIN` pin then the  7.5V to 12.6V range of your lithium batteries will be okay...

💬 [3] dapoliceisoncrack (12:42:24 PM)
when i did it i just soldered wires straight to where the power(9v) connecter would go

💬 [4] dapoliceisoncrack (12:42:32 PM)
arduino uno r3 btw

💬 [5] dapoliceisoncrack (12:42:34 PM)
and it seems to work fine

💬 [6] toph2814 (12:43:00 PM)
yes... that barrel connector is actually tied to the `VIN` so essentially the same input

💬 [7] dapoliceisoncrack (12:43:07 PM)
but i did sort of blow up another arduino, but im not sure if it was a result of the overvolting, or a short that happened in a possibly related part of the cirucuit

💬 [8] dapoliceisoncrack (12:43:11 PM) [REPLY]
ok

💬 [9] dapoliceisoncrack (12:43:33 PM)
i dont know much about the circuitry of the arduino itself as you can probably tell

💬 [10] toph2814 (12:43:42 PM)
both will feed power to the onboard LDO voltage regulator which drops it for the 5V the Arduino needs

💬 [11] dapoliceisoncrack (12:43:54 PM)
oh ok thats nice to know

💬 [12] toph2814 (12:45:28 PM)
👉 when the battery is full, it will cause the regulator to heat up though only for a few moments as the 3S battery drains to around the 12V mark... which shouldn't be enough to damage it *(though unfortunately there are many knockoffs that use inferior components on their boards that could be damaged even by a brief stint at 12V...)*

🎯 [13] toph2814 (12:46:26 PM)
🤓 fyi, here's the official schematics of the Arduino UNO R3 if you're curious @crackity:
📚 https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Arduino_Uno_Rev3-schematic.pdf

💬 [14] dapoliceisoncrack (12:47:05 PM) [REPLY]
interesting

💬 [15] dapoliceisoncrack (12:47:12 PM)
generally i try to not charge my lipos to max

💬 [16] toph2814 (12:47:23 PM)
good policy

💬 [17] dapoliceisoncrack (12:47:28 PM)
to prolong lifetime, hopefully it will prolong the lifetime of my arduino too lol

💬 [18] toph2814 (12:47:55 PM)
should be good... hopefully you also added protection circuitry that will prevent over discharge

💬 [19] dapoliceisoncrack (12:48:13 PM)
i should implement that, but still have not

💬 [20] dapoliceisoncrack (12:48:31 PM)
i destroyed one lipo by over discharge

💬 [21] toph2814 (12:48:38 PM)
*(you don't want to drain your 3S LiPos below 8V ~I'd do 9V for longevity)*

💬 [22] dapoliceisoncrack (12:48:49 PM) [REPLY]
because when i revived it i charged it MUCH to quickly

💬 [23] dapoliceisoncrack (12:49:14 PM)
2 of the cells were basically empty

💬 [24] toph2814 (12:49:47 PM)
"reviving" is dangerous though... hopefully you've taken the appropriate precautions

💬 [25] dapoliceisoncrack (12:50:02 PM)
yea i basically didnt take any precautions lol

💬 [26] dapoliceisoncrack (12:50:09 PM)
i do jank things

💬 [27] dapoliceisoncrack (12:50:13 PM)
which probably isnt great

💬 [28] dapoliceisoncrack (12:50:28 PM)
it did work when i revived it

💬 [29] dapoliceisoncrack (12:50:37 PM)
but the issue is it drained ridiculously quickly

💬 [30] dapoliceisoncrack (12:50:51 PM)
even with it powering nothing

💬 [31] toph2814 (12:50:59 PM)
please stop spamming the channel with multiple statements & use paragraphs

💬 [32] el3phanten (12:51:03 PM)
Hi, is there a preferred channel or server for "arduino plc ide" questions?

💬 [33] dapoliceisoncrack (12:51:11 PM) [REPLY]

💬 [34] toph2814 (12:52:17 PM)
PLC isn't really that popular but you can feel free to post your question here @el3phantenor the #hardware-help or #coding-help channels to start an appropriate thread ... hopefully someone experienced in them can answer you...

💬 [9] kaito2112 (9:52:11 PM)
If you're going to do a lot of Arduino/Microcontroller stuff, a soldering iron is essential. It's like trying to be a carpenter without a hammer and saw: Yes, you can get away without them for a project or two (with great difficulty), but it's easier to just buy the proper tool

💬 [10] kaito2112 (9:52:41 PM)
Also, remember that the - of the capacitor needs to go to gnd *and* the + needs to go to Vcc

💬 [146] canadiianmango (10:13:20 PM)
‘Cause it always hurt

💬 [147] canadiianmango (10:13:25 PM)
And some people didn’t get as lucky as me

💬 [148] canadiianmango (10:13:33 PM)
Some of them had to lose their arms and legs and stuff

💬 [149] poki96 (10:13:36 PM)
Oh

💬 [150] canadiianmango (10:13:39 PM)
So, I’d like to make prosthetics

💬 [151] canadiianmango (10:13:48 PM)
Help them give back what life took from ‘em.

💬 [152] poki96 (10:13:57 PM)
Aww that’s sweet of you :))

💬 [153] canadiianmango (10:14:04 PM)
But for that I need some good track records

And, hey, farming robot helps folk.

💬 [154] canadiianmango (10:14:19 PM) [REPLY]
Only the thought. There’s so much to do if I want to see it come to fruition.

💬 [155] poki96 (10:14:33 PM)
Yea

💬 [156] canadiianmango (10:14:44 PM) [REPLY]
The arduino is more so I can learn how to make projects

💬 [157] poki96 (10:14:45 PM)
You just gotta work hard and keep pushing no matter what

💬 [158] canadiianmango (10:14:51 PM)
Because a solid project portfolio helps

💬 [159] poki96 (10:15:12 PM)
Yea I’m trying to make a project portfolio too lol

💬 [160] canadiianmango (10:15:15 PM)
But ngl studying this so far, I love coding languages

I still don’t know what a pointer is exactly but I’m having fun

💬 [161] poki96 (10:15:20 PM)
Maybe get into a good engineering school

💬 [162] canadiianmango (10:15:21 PM) [REPLY]
Amen.

💬 [163] canadiianmango (10:15:33 PM) [REPLY]
If you don’t mind sharing, you got any unis you’re gunning for?

💬 [164] poki96 (10:15:43 PM)
Yea

💬 [165] poki96 (10:15:47 PM)
My top three

💬 [166] poki96 (10:15:56 PM)
Is the top three best engineering schools

💬 [167] canadiianmango (10:16:01 PM)
In the US?

💬 [168] poki96 (10:16:08 PM)
World

💬 [169] canadiianmango (10:16:12 PM)
Ohh.

💬 [170] canadiianmango (10:16:18 PM)
I take it that’s MIT, and some others?

💬 [171] poki96 (10:16:22 PM)
Which is all in us lol

💬 [172] canadiianmango (10:16:30 PM) [REPLY]
They have great universities.

💬 [173] canadiianmango (10:16:47 PM)
At any rate, kudos for going for the big fish. Make sure to take them AP classes, they help a bunch

💬 [174] poki96 (10:16:49 PM) [REPLY]
MIT, caltech, Berkeley

💬 [175] canadiianmango (10:17:04 PM) [REPLY]
Heard of MIT and Berkeley, caltech is new t’ me

💬 [176] poki96 (10:17:12 PM) [REPLY]
I can only take one ap class in my current school :/

💬 [177] canadiianmango (10:17:44 PM) [REPLY]
That’s rough. Though, I came from a school with zero AP classes

What I did is I just paid to take the final exam of some AP courses, and self-studied

💬 [178] canadiianmango (10:17:50 PM)
I would look into that if you had the money

💬 [179] poki96 (10:17:50 PM) [REPLY]
Ah caltech it’s really good too

💬 [180] canadiianmango (10:18:01 PM)
Bc that’s a good way of circumventing the problem if it’s possible for you

💬 [181] poki96 (10:18:12 PM)
Wait you can do that?????

💬 [182] canadiianmango (10:18:20 PM) [REPLY]
That’s pretty lovely to hear. You seem hardworking, I reckon you’ll make it.

💬 [183] canadiianmango (10:18:24 PM) [REPLY]
I was surprised, too.

💬 [184] canadiianmango (10:18:46 PM)
Though, do take note that we’re talking about Canada here, so that may be the standard since Collegeboard is US based anyway

💬 [185] canadiianmango (10:18:52 PM)
I would speak to your teacher.

💬 [186] poki96 (10:18:58 PM) [REPLY]
Yea about that…
Admissions rate is like 3 percent 💀

💬 [187] poki96 (10:19:17 PM) [REPLY]
Oh that makes sense

💬 [188] canadiianmango (10:19:37 PM) [REPLY]
Well, I can already see you’re working on a project portfolio, which is a step in the right direction

Bc I’ve discovered it’s not just about the grades, but also about the life experience

💬 [189] canadiianmango (10:19:47 PM)
Go volunteer, gain some skills, etc

💬 [190] poki96 (10:19:55 PM)
Yea and the essay

💬 [191] poki96 (10:20:08 PM)
Most important part

💬 [192] canadiianmango (10:20:10 PM)
At the end of the day the unis really just want to keep their reputation as prestigious, so the goal is just to shine as a candidate.

💬 [193] poki96 (10:20:21 PM)
Real

💬 [194] canadiianmango (10:20:25 PM)
Both in what you can do, and why you wanna do it.

💬 [195] canadiianmango (10:20:47 PM) [REPLY]
I would still check it out though because if you can do it, it’s a great choice

💬 [196] canadiianmango (10:20:49 PM)
Then again

💬 [197] canadiianmango (10:21:00 PM)
I hear that a lot is determined by the SAT in America

💬 [198] canadiianmango (10:21:12 PM)
So if that doesn’t work then I would just study like hell for the SAT

💬 [199] poki96 (10:21:32 PM)
Yea lol

💬 [200] poki96 (10:21:39 PM)
Well not exactly

💬 [201] poki96 (10:21:43 PM)
Sat is important

💬 [202] canadiianmango (10:21:44 PM) [REPLY]
Oh?

💬 [203] poki96 (10:21:57 PM)
But talking about those top 20 unis

💬 [204] poki96 (10:22:09 PM)
Then it doesn’t matter too much

💬 [205] canadiianmango (10:22:14 PM)
I see.

💬 [206] poki96 (10:22:20 PM)
Yea

💬 [207] canadiianmango (10:22:20 PM)
Then, I would just do what you’re doing rn

💬 [208] canadiianmango (10:22:23 PM)
Projects, studying

💬 [209] canadiianmango (10:22:31 PM)
Maybe learn some languages, even if it’s duolingo level

💬 [210] canadiianmango (10:22:42 PM)
But then again that’s just me being biased bc I love studying languages

💬 [211] poki96 (10:22:49 PM)
lol

💬 [212] poki96 (10:22:55 PM)
What languages have u learned?

💬 [213] canadiianmango (10:23:36 PM) [REPLY]
I love when people ask me this question, because I’m allowed to say that depending on your political standpoint of Southern Europe, I speak anywhere between 2 to 5 languages properly.

💬 [214] poki96 (10:23:54 PM)
What

💬 [215] poki96 (10:24:06 PM)
0_o

💬 [216] canadiianmango (10:24:12 PM)
My parents are Bosnian

And that used to be part of a bigger place called Yugoslavia

💬 [217] canadiianmango (10:24:24 PM)
N Yugoslavia was the last communist country in Europe I think

💬 [218] canadiianmango (10:24:29 PM)
They broke up, and hella wars happened

💬 [219] canadiianmango (10:24:47 PM)
And so the nationalism between each new country (formerly provinces of Yugoslavia) run deep

💬 [220] poki96 (10:24:57 PM)
Ohh

💬 [221] canadiianmango (10:25:00 PM)
So much so that each country has declared their own official language

💬 [222] canadiianmango (10:25:11 PM)
But the official languages, while different on paper, are spoken the same

💬 [223] poki96 (10:25:16 PM)
Ah that’s makes sense

💬 [224] canadiianmango (10:25:22 PM)
The one difference is that some are written in cyrillic

💬 [225] canadiianmango (10:25:37 PM)
But that’s not that challenging to overcome when you already know the language

💬 [226] canadiianmango (10:25:48 PM)
So, depending on whether you think the countries have their own independent language

💬 [227] canadiianmango (10:26:05 PM)
I speak English, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, and Montenegrin,

💬 [228] canadiianmango (10:26:23 PM)
But if you think it’s the same, I only speak English and Serbo-Croatian

💬 [229] poki96 (10:26:27 PM)
That’s cool lol

💬 [230] canadiianmango (10:26:30 PM)
To me, obviously it’s one language

💬 [231] canadiianmango (10:26:35 PM)
But I find it to be a cool little fact

💬 [232] canadiianmango (10:26:48 PM)
Currently I’m studying Chinese, but I’m nowhere near fluent.

💬 [233] poki96 (10:26:54 PM)
Really?

💬 [234] canadiianmango (10:26:59 PM) [REPLY]
Yup.

💬 [235] poki96 (10:27:01 PM)
I know some Chinese too lol

💬 [236] canadiianmango (10:27:12 PM) [REPLY]
Oh, that’s pretty cool!

💬 [237] poki96 (10:27:18 PM)
Ye

💬 [238] canadiianmango (10:27:24 PM)
I would try striking up conversation but I am 99% certain you know more

💬 [239] poki96 (10:27:30 PM)
I’m bad at remembering the words lol

💬 [240] canadiianmango (10:27:41 PM) [REPLY]
It’s all the rules that get me

💬 [241] poki96 (10:27:49 PM) [REPLY]
My Chinese is alright

💬 [242] canadiianmango (10:27:52 PM)
Like how time statements go between the subject and the verb

💬 [243] canadiianmango (10:27:55 PM)
And then the object

💬 [244] canadiianmango (10:28:10 PM)
But then as you stack on adjectives and other particles it becomes super messy

💬 [245] poki96 (10:28:25 PM)
Er not exactly

💬 [246] poki96 (10:28:37 PM)
Oh it’s just how English is structured tho

💬 [247] canadiianmango (10:28:50 PM)
It is, but it’s slightly different in some ways that do throw me off

💬 [248] canadiianmango (10:29:13 PM)
Because Serbo-Croatian, the only other language I speak, is wildly different to English and Chinese in nearly everything

💬 [249] poki96 (10:29:15 PM)
Yea some of the pronunciation especially the I

💬 [250] canadiianmango (10:29:24 PM)
So I have no past experience to go off of

💬 [251] canadiianmango (10:29:42 PM)
On the contrary, sometimes I end up wording my Chinese in a Serbo-Croatian manner by nature

💬 [252] poki96 (10:29:54 PM)
Huh?

💬 [253] canadiianmango (10:30:20 PM) [REPLY]
Like, you know how when someone speaks broken English, they’re speaking English using the same grammatical rules as their mother tongue?

💬 [254] poki96 (10:30:29 PM)
Ohh

💬 [255] canadiianmango (10:30:39 PM)
Yup

💬 [256] poki96 (10:30:40 PM)
Yea that makes sense

💬 [257] poki96 (10:30:55 PM)
To be fair tho you don’t need to get the grammar perfect

💬 [258] canadiianmango (10:31:10 PM)
My biggest worry is the tones I can’t lie

💬 [259] canadiianmango (10:31:17 PM)
The grammar I’ll learn with practice

💬 [260] poki96 (10:31:20 PM)
You just need some of it to make sense

💬 [261] canadiianmango (10:31:23 PM)
But the tones sound all the same to me

💬 [262] canadiianmango (10:31:30 PM)
Not to mention the subtle differences between, like

💬 [263] canadiianmango (10:31:33 PM)
“En” and “eng”

💬 [264] poki96 (10:31:45 PM)
Yea some of them sound a lot alike

💬 [265] canadiianmango (10:31:55 PM)
Which sucks to have to memorize!

💬 [266] poki96 (10:32:14 PM)
Well you don’t have to memorize them exactly

💬 [267] poki96 (10:32:24 PM)
Just have to try to pick out the differences

💬 [268] canadiianmango (10:32:41 PM) [REPLY]
This is true

💬 [269] canadiianmango (10:32:47 PM)
I can’t lie, though

💬 [270] canadiianmango (10:32:52 PM)
Shoulda started with Japanese.

💬 [271] canadiianmango (10:33:10 PM)
Very similar writing system

And even though the grammar is different it’s so easy to pronounce

💬 [272] canadiianmango (10:33:21 PM)
It’s just consonant + vowel.

💬 [273] canadiianmango (10:33:27 PM)
Never heard a language be pronounced as simply.

💬 [274] poki96 (10:34:26 PM)
Nah

💬 [275] canadiianmango (10:34:37 PM) [REPLY]
Really?

💬 [276] poki96 (10:34:49 PM)
Japanese kanji is confusing

💬 [277] poki96 (10:35:01 PM)
The pronunciation is easier

💬 [278] poki96 (10:35:15 PM)
But the words are so hard to learn

💬 [279] poki96 (10:35:26 PM)
Because everything sounds the same

💬 [280] canadiianmango (10:35:33 PM) [REPLY]
Mah, that’s what the dictionary is for.

💬 [281] canadiianmango (10:35:38 PM) [REPLY]
Really?

💬 [282] poki96 (10:35:43 PM)
Ye

💬 [283] canadiianmango (10:35:44 PM)
I never would have guessedz

💬 [284] canadiianmango (10:36:02 PM)
I really just thought it was like

The consonant and then just the vowel

💬 [285] canadiianmango (10:36:11 PM)
“Ka, ki, ku, ke, ko”

💬 [286] poki96 (10:36:21 PM) [REPLY]
Ye but that means the differences between words are going to be very subtle and you may confuse a word with another

💬 [287] canadiianmango (10:36:40 PM) [REPLY]
Isn’t that what the context cues are for

💬 [288] poki96 (10:37:05 PM) [REPLY]
Exactly 😭

💬 [289] poki96 (10:37:22 PM) [REPLY]
Wait what context cues?

💬 [290] canadiianmango (10:37:25 PM) [REPLY]
I really have no idea how babies learn the language so flawlessly

💬 [291] canadiianmango (10:37:31 PM) [REPLY]
For example, like

💬 [292] canadiianmango (10:37:50 PM)
Two Japanese words I know is “harami” which is pregnancy
And “harami” which is also a type of steak

💬 [293] canadiianmango (10:37:54 PM)
(At least, I think).

💬 [294] canadiianmango (10:38:03 PM)
So, if you say, “I like [harami]”

💬 [295] kaito2112 (10:38:06 PM) [REPLY]
Humans are genetically predisposed to pick up language

💬 [296] canadiianmango (10:38:13 PM)
It’s kinda inferred you’re saying you enjoy steak

💬 [297] canadiianmango (10:38:16 PM)
Not pregnancy.

💬 [298] poki96 (10:38:23 PM)
Yea you could do that

💬 [299] canadiianmango (10:38:29 PM) [REPLY]
Which is so fascinating, isn’t it

💬 [300] poki96 (10:38:30 PM)
But sometimes it’s not that easy lol

💬 [301] kaito2112 (10:38:40 PM) [REPLY]
Tonal languages. English has like, 1 or 2 like that

💬 [302] canadiianmango (10:38:49 PM) [REPLY]
That’s true, but you have to realize most conversations aren’t just one sentence

💬 [303] canadiianmango (10:38:57 PM)
So you gain other clues from what has already been said

💬 [304] canadiianmango (10:39:16 PM) [REPLY]
T’ Kaito, or me?

💬 [305] canadiianmango (10:39:21 PM) [REPLY]
Take care, now!

💬 [306] poki96 (10:39:39 PM) [REPLY]
See ya boss man

💬 [307] canadiianmango (10:39:54 PM)
I best be going too

💬 [308] canadiianmango (10:39:57 PM)
Got an exam in some

💬 [309] canadiianmango (10:40:02 PM)
15 hours?

💬 [310] canadiianmango (10:40:05 PM)
More like 20

💬 [311] kaito2112 (10:40:06 PM)
Best of luck

💬 [312] canadiianmango (10:40:07 PM)
But still

💬 [313] kaito2112 (10:40:10 PM)
Get some good sleep

💬 [314] poki96 (10:40:10 PM)
Gl

💬 [315] canadiianmango (10:40:12 PM)
It’s on engineering ethics

💬 [316] canadiianmango (10:40:19 PM)
Fuck if I know what engineering ethics are

💬 [317] canadiianmango (10:40:30 PM) [REPLY]
Unfortunately I don’t get to sleep till after the exam

💬 [318] poki96 (10:40:34 PM)
There ethics in engineering? 💀

💬 [319] canadiianmango (10:40:43 PM) [REPLY]
I know, right? 💀

💬 [320] kaito2112 (10:40:44 PM) [REPLY]
Have you ever seen that smarter every day video about this?

💬 [321] canadiianmango (10:40:50 PM)
It’s as you expect though

💬 [322] canadiianmango (10:41:02 PM)
“Yeah the environment and the law is cool, but remember the guys paying you are cooler”

💬 [323] canadiianmango (10:41:12 PM) [REPLY]
No, why?

💬 [324] poki96 (10:41:13 PM)
Exactly

💬 [325] kaito2112 (10:41:35 PM) [REPLY]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoJsPvmFixU

The tl;dr is that as an engineer, you have a *responsibility* to speak up when something is wrong

💬 [326] canadiianmango (10:41:49 PM) [REPLY]
This was actually last semester’s ethics exam

💬 [327] canadiianmango (10:41:52 PM)
This semester is

💬 [328] kaito2112 (10:41:54 PM)
lol

💬 [329] kaito2112 (10:41:55 PM)
okay

💬 [330] canadiianmango (10:41:55 PM)
about mining for some reason

💬 [331] poki96 (10:42:03 PM)
Huh

💬 [332] canadiianmango (10:42:07 PM)
Don’t ask me. I never attend that class.

💬 [333] canadiianmango (10:42:14 PM)
I hate it they are so damn inefficient

💬 [334] poki96 (10:42:23 PM)
Then why u taking the exam for it 💀

💬 [335] canadiianmango (10:42:31 PM)
The school year ended 3 weeks ago

I’m on my last exam

💬 [336] canadiianmango (10:42:42 PM)
And they are just now returning graded work from the start of the semester

💬 [337] canadiianmango (10:42:53 PM) [REPLY]
They introduce content online through short videos

💬 [338] poki96 (10:42:55 PM)
What???

💬 [339] canadiianmango (10:43:03 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah they take fucking forever

💬 [340] poki96 (10:43:12 PM)
Why?

💬 [341] canadiianmango (10:43:21 PM) [REPLY]
Mostly because they scale shit like crazy

💬 [342] canadiianmango (10:43:29 PM)
So it just takes forever to factor in the scaling

💬 [343] poki96 (10:43:36 PM)
What’s scaling?

💬 [344] canadiianmango (10:43:47 PM) [REPLY]
In university the exams are just astronomically tougher

💬 [345] canadiianmango (10:43:55 PM)
Often to the point where in upper yeats

💬 [346] canadiianmango (10:44:04 PM)
It’s not too uncommon for an entire class to fail a test

💬 [347] canadiianmango (10:44:10 PM)
So what they do is

💬 [348] poki96 (10:44:16 PM) [REPLY]
What

💬 [349] canadiianmango (10:44:17 PM)
They take all the grades of the people who took the exam

💬 [350] canadiianmango (10:44:26 PM)
And they see who got the highest and lowest grade among them

💬 [351] poki96 (10:44:32 PM)
Oh

💬 [352] canadiianmango (10:44:33 PM)
Let’s say the highest got like, 32%

💬 [353] canadiianmango (10:44:38 PM)
and the lowest got 3%

💬 [354] poki96 (10:44:39 PM)
💀

💬 [355] kaito2112 (10:44:44 PM)
Grading on a curve

💬 [356] poki96 (10:44:45 PM)
That’s low

💬 [357] canadiianmango (10:44:46 PM)
They basically set 32% to be an A

💬 [358] canadiianmango (10:44:54 PM)
And 3% to be an F

💬 [359] poki96 (10:44:59 PM)
Damn

💬 [360] poki96 (10:45:08 PM) [REPLY]
Oh that makes sense

💬 [361] canadiianmango (10:45:16 PM) [REPLY]
I’m only a first year, but I do believe that in engineering specifically, it gets very common

💬 [362] canadiianmango (10:45:21 PM)
Maybe someone here can confirm

💬 [363] poki96 (10:45:27 PM)
Not exactly

💬 [364] kaito2112 (10:45:33 PM)
Be the one to get a 100 and ruin the curve for everyone 😈

💬 [365] canadiianmango (10:45:44 PM) [REPLY]
That’s the goal of everyone though

💬 [366] canadiianmango (10:45:50 PM)
It just gets that hard

💬 [367] poki96 (10:45:56 PM) [REPLY]
Ig it just depends on the engineering type u want to go into

💬 [368] poki96 (10:46:19 PM) [REPLY]
Wait but if everyone fails

💬 [369] poki96 (10:46:28 PM)
And gets like a 3

💬 [370] poki96 (10:46:33 PM)
Then do they all pass?

💬 [371] canadiianmango (10:46:39 PM)
I think so

💬 [372] canadiianmango (10:46:45 PM)
But naturally there’s generally some variation

💬 [373] kaito2112 (10:46:46 PM)
Yeah don't take that chance

💬 [374] poki96 (10:46:52 PM)
What 💀

sectors are an artifact of when we stored data on spinning rust

💬 [2] ja_pinkerton (1:52:37 AM)
calder - have you read the docs?

💬 [3] ja_pinkerton (1:54:57 AM)
because it looks kinda easy.    But I suspect your question is "how do I know what to write where?   How do I know where to read what I wrote?"

💬 [4] ja_pinkerton (1:56:30 AM)
And I think the answer is "flash memory isn't a file system."     You want to allocate the addresses by hand or at least at compile time.  So you know that address 0 is always one thing, and address 128 is some other thing, and address 132 is a third thing

my cousin lifted the two pads on this dualsense 5 trying to desolder them. anyone know how i can solder them now that the pads are lifted?

💬 [2] cometseer (11:40:18 AM) [REPLY]
I think you can scratch off the traces and solder a wire directly

💬 [3] Deleted User (11:40:58 AM) [REPLY]
umm scratch where?

💬 [4] Deleted User (11:41:23 AM)
the traces surrounding them?

💬 [5] cometseer (11:41:26 AM)
I mean those pads must lead from somewhere yea?

💬 [6] cometseer (11:41:41 AM)
I don't have the diagram for that board in specific

heres the back of the board

💬 [8] cometseer (11:42:38 AM)
is this it?

💬 [9] Deleted User (11:42:40 AM)
i was thinking of scratching those two on the bottom and using a wire

💬 [10] Deleted User (11:43:20 AM)
woah thats neat lemme see

💬 [11] Deleted User (11:43:35 AM)
hmmm i dont think so unfortunately

💬 [12] cometseer (11:45:03 AM)
I'll look for a dualsense 5 diagram

💬 [13] toph2814 (11:45:11 AM)
unfortunately those pads aren't connected to the plane around it

💬 [14] toph2814 (11:45:41 AM)
it'll definitely be tricky if that's meant to be connected to a layer somewhere in between

💬 [15] Deleted User (11:48:07 AM) [REPLY]
it seems like the pads underneath are still intact, can i actually solder them on the back instead?

💬 [16] toph2814 (11:48:28 AM)
if that's where they're supposed to be connected then yes....

💬 [17] Deleted User (11:48:36 AM)
wait acrually nvm the joysticks are covering them

I'm trying to look at the analog stick pins, is there like 2 pins for ground

💬 [25] cometseer (12:00:21 PM)
4 pins, 2 pins for ground

💬 [26] cometseer (12:02:20 PM)
hmm kinda hard without schematics/diagrams

💬 [27] anathrax (12:08:30 PM)
Hello, out of these two schematics, which do you think makes more sense? (I want to use buttons as voltage sensors)

💬 [28] anonengineering (12:09:19 PM) [REPLY]
usually the grounds are all in common, so you have Vcc, ground, X axis, Y axis, switch
that joystick looks like all the pins are broken out

💬 [29] anonengineering (12:10:53 PM) [REPLY]
they both are correct, left is pull down, right is pull up

💬 [30] fileross (12:11:30 PM) [REPLY]
Idk the answer, but what software is that?

💬 [31] anathrax (12:13:48 PM) [REPLY]
am not sure that why are resistors used in first schematic. When I press the button, voltage should be disconnected no?

💬 [32] anonengineering (12:16:48 PM) [REPLY]
on the left the resistor holds the pin LOW until you press the button, I'd use 10K resistors for the pullup or pull downs

💬 [33] anonengineering (12:17:42 PM) [REPLY]
i usually use `INPUT_PULLUP` so I don't need to add resistors myself at all

💬 [34] anathrax (12:20:45 PM) [REPLY]
oh interesting, although am still not sure how it holds pin LOW. Wouldnt it be low without it?

💬 [35] anathrax (12:21:22 PM)
yea I want to understand

💬 [36] anonengineering (12:21:41 PM)
in my diagram the internal pullup resistor holds the pin HIGH, until you press the button, which brings the pin LOW

💬 [37] anathrax (12:22:26 PM) [REPLY]
I see, that looks much more cleaner as well

💬 [38] anathrax (12:23:27 PM)
thanks

🎯 [39] anathrax (12:27:24 PM) [REPLY]
It's fritzing, much like tinkercad but generates nicer schematics imo

is it normal that ALL of the pins on my arduino pro micro are somehow connected all to each other?
for example with a multimeter continuity test it shows pin 2 and pin 8 are connected
It connects just fine on the software and uploads work fine.
Its just that on my other microcontrollers pins aren't connected like that.

💬 [2] akumasaru (1:05:15 PM) [REPLY]
any GPIO pin or are there any off limit ones?  Digital or Analog GPIO pins work?  what about the ~ pwm pins?

no, it is not normal

usually 0 & 1 (on an Uno) should be avoided, they are used to upload code
the other 18 are GPIO, some have added capability, like analog or PWM

the TX of the Uno is 5v, so it needs to be divided down to 3.3v for the HC RX

when the HC-05 sends data it is talking (TX), the uno listens for the data on its RX pin

💬 [135] flamingo3438 (2:55:17 PM)
for now only thos i gotta do now and the connection i wrote above?

💬 [136] flamingo3438 (2:55:26 PM) [REPLY]
i get that

💬 [137] anonengineering (2:55:47 PM)
so HC TX goes to Uno RX (pin 2)

💬 [138] flamingo3438 (2:56:41 PM)
oh so TX to pin 2

💬 [139] flamingo3438 (2:56:46 PM)
and RX to 13

💬 [140] flamingo3438 (2:56:50 PM)
clear.

💬 [141] anonengineering (2:57:48 PM)
```c++
SoftwareSerial BTSerial(10, 11); // RX (Arduino 10) <-> TX (HC-05), TX (Arduino 11) <-> RX (HC-05)```
the first parameter is the RX pin

💬 [142] flamingo3438 (2:59:10 PM)
yes i get it

💬 [143] flamingo3438 (2:59:18 PM)
you sure its 2 and 13

💬 [149] anonengineering (3:00:26 PM)
does the app connect to the HC?

💬 [150] flamingo3438 (3:00:38 PM)
yeah it does

💬 [151] anonengineering (3:00:56 PM)
and do you know the HC is set to 9600 baud?

💬 [152] flamingo3438 (3:01:22 PM)
is it?no i didnt

💬 [153] flamingo3438 (3:01:48 PM)
gpt told me u need to match baud rate of hc with the baud rate of app

💬 [154] flamingo3438 (3:01:54 PM)
something like thi exists?

💬 [155] anonengineering (3:02:11 PM)
it may or may not be, depends on HC
```c++
BTSerial.begin(9600); // HC-05 default baud rate```

💬 [156] anonengineering (3:03:00 PM)
you can try 38400, another common rate those come set to from the factory

💬 [157] anonengineering (3:03:52 PM)
and, if you had 5v and ground swapped, the module might be damaged...

💬 [158] anonengineering (3:04:40 PM)

💬 [175] flamingo3438 (3:44:35 PM)
i get it man

💬 [176] anonengineering (3:45:50 PM)
what do you see?
The HC-05 Bluetooth module uses blinking LED patterns to indicate its status. Rapid flashing (around 2 Hz) indicates communication mode, not connected. Two rapid flashes followed by a longer pause signify communication mode, connected. A slow, steady flash (on for 2 seconds, off for 2 seconds) indicates the module is in AT mode, ready for configuration commands.

💬 [177] akumasaru (3:46:48 PM)
@AnonEngineering Your saying that if I put this capacitor here, I can remove the other two?

💬 [178] akumasaru (3:46:58 PM)


💬 [179] anonengineering (3:47:21 PM)
a single 10 - 100uF cap across the power rails should be sufficient

💬 [180] anonengineering (3:48:12 PM)
for high frequency noise a 100nF in parallel might be good too

💬 [181] flamingo3438 (3:48:39 PM) [REPLY]
here's what we did
put the code in arduino IDE with 2 and 13 as modifications.connected as mentioned in the replied message. taken out the rx and tx pins out of BT module and uploaded the code.once uploaded. put back the rx and tx back at its place.then connect the Bluetoothmodule with my device and further with the app. tried to print anything random using erial Bluetooth app you provided. and it shows nothing.

💬 [182] anonengineering (3:49:33 PM)
BT TX is connected to pin 2?

💬 [183] flamingo3438 (3:49:43 PM) [REPLY]
i see rapid when its not connected and then a rapid flash in which red and blue light at the same time followed by a pause..that all

💬 [184] flamingo3438 (3:49:56 PM) [REPLY]
after its connected w the app.

💬 [185] flamingo3438 (3:50:04 PM) [REPLY]
yes

💬 [186] flamingo3438 (3:50:13 PM)
and rx to 13

💬 [187] anonengineering (3:50:20 PM)
Two rapid flashes followed by a longer pause signify communication mode, connected.  ?

💬 [188] flamingo3438 (3:50:37 PM)
yess

💬 [189] flamingo3438 (3:50:41 PM)
i see this

💬 [190] flamingo3438 (3:50:45 PM)
but not the steady flash

💬 [191] anonengineering (3:51:21 PM)
ok, then it is connected and reading `BTSerial` should be giving you something

💬 [192] flamingo3438 (3:51:47 PM)
do i need to experiment with the baud rate

💬 [193] flamingo3438 (3:51:54 PM)
because its not working

💬 [194] akumasaru (3:51:55 PM)
they have to match

💬 [195] flamingo3438 (3:52:38 PM)
i understand

💬 [196] akumasaru (3:52:43 PM)
but bx/tx is different from say serial

💬 [197] anonengineering (3:52:43 PM)
they do need to match, but unless you are in AT command mode you know know for sure what the HC-05 is set to

💬 [198] flamingo3438 (3:53:09 PM) [REPLY]
and im unable to reach at this stage right

💬 [199] anonengineering (3:53:18 PM) [REPLY]
actually the HC-05 adds a serial port, just a wireless one

💬 [200] flamingo3438 (3:53:29 PM)
and whats the baud when it is in AT command mode

💬 [201] anonengineering (3:53:53 PM)
in command mode you tell it what baudrate to use

💬 [202] anonengineering (3:54:12 PM)
realistically it's 9600, 19200, or 38400

💬 [203] flamingo3438 (3:55:05 PM)
this reminded me in. my theory exam yeterday there was a question saying which of these is a baud rate in serial communication. I didnt know the anwer lmao.

💬 [204] flamingo3438 (3:55:18 PM)
I havent cramed every baud rat enow ofc

💬 [205] flamingo3438 (3:55:23 PM)
or maybe there is a way to know

💬 [206] flamingo3438 (3:55:24 PM)
idk

💬 [207] akumasaru (3:55:36 PM)
There are multiple ones you can use.  9600 is like the well known one.

💬 [208] anonengineering (3:55:39 PM)
they are all valid rates, just both sides need to use the same rate

💬 [209] flamingo3438 (3:55:48 PM) [REPLY]
exactly. this was the only one i knew

instead of making a connection between the board snd the pin but i cant see from these angles

If it's right it will not work right?

💬 [5] nothing08664 (5:27:05 AM)
help 🥹

💬 [6] nothing08664 (5:28:23 AM)
it shows Not connected and at the same time it says arduino Uno on COM3, isn't that contradictory?

💬 [7] toph2814 (5:58:06 AM) [REPLY]
not really... the error indicates that the UNO was not detected *(IDE couldn't communicate with the board)* ... whereas having the IDE set to communicate on COM3 is an option that is user selectable *(it's possible that at one point the UNO was indeed at COM3 but it isn't anymore)*

💬 [8] toph2814 (5:58:23 AM)
👉 I recommend checking your `Device Manager → Ports` to see if the Arduino is listed there & at which port... *(you can unplug & reconnect the UNO to verify the correct port ~it should disappear when unplugged & reappear when reconnected)*

💬 [9] gummysharp (6:15:54 AM)
Have you guys ever had issues with the copper traces lifting off a board when desoldering and what's your solution?

💬 [10] nothing08664 (6:18:08 AM) [REPLY]
It seems to be listed in the ports section on COM3 when i go to device manager

💬 [11] toph2814 (7:36:12 AM) [REPLY]
common occurrance when you overheat the pads during soldering... too much heat will make them delaminate from the fiberboard surface

🎯 [12] toph2814 (7:39:43 AM) [REPLY]
okay. so that indicates that your UNO isn't responding when the IDE attempts to communicate with it during programming...
👉 make sure there's nothing connected to pins 0 & 1 of the UNO board... these pins are used for communications with the IDE & PC...
👉 if there's nothing connected to those pins, try hitting the [`RESET`] button twice *(to force the UNO into "bootloader" mode)*   just before hitting the button on the IDE to upload your code ...

💬 [13] ja_pinkerton (8:51:22 PM) [REPLY]
It might work.  It might not.  You want your solder to be on the pad and on the pin and to form a convex cone.

💬 [14] ja_pinkerton (8:52:07 PM) [REPLY]
Hate when that happens.  the solution is use less heat.

💬 [16] giacomo_tura (12:13:05 PM) [REPLY]
oh so i dont have to heat the solder, nice to know

💬 [17] akumasaru (3:10:57 PM)
cause my power supply can go to up to 30V.  Not looking to plug  anything that is 30V into it that I know of.  But was curious if these breadboards would handle 12v from the power supply, as it can handle 9v apparently?

💬 [18] anonengineering (3:15:01 PM)
they will handle <=25 volts, they don't handle high current (>= 1 amp)

💬 [19] akumasaru (3:15:32 PM)
and that would be 1.000 A

💬 [20] akumasaru (3:15:34 PM)
?

💬 [21] anonengineering (3:16:19 PM)
i suppose you could get away with 1.001 A 🙂

💬 [22] akumasaru (3:16:40 PM)
Cause I have the DPS-150

💬 [23] akumasaru (3:16:48 PM)
and I'll be using that instead of the 9v battery they show there.

💬 [24] ja_pinkerton (3:16:50 PM)
IIRC, I've done 120v AC (low current) through a breadboard.  But this was back in CEGEP in the 90s.  Recent made in China boards might not handle it

💬 [25] anonengineering (3:17:24 PM) [REPLY]
yes, just set the current limit appropriately

💬 [26] akumasaru (3:17:35 PM)
👍

💬 [27] anonengineering (3:18:03 PM) [REPLY]
for safeties sake never connect mains to a breadboard

we don't want to give kids any ideas ... 🙂

💬 [30] ja_pinkerton (3:19:08 PM) [REPLY]
you heat the 2 parts hot enough that they melt the solder.

💬 [31] ja_pinkerton (3:19:37 PM)
I remember sparks and a few jolts.  but no fire and only a few blown fuses

💬 [32] akumasaru (3:20:12 PM) [REPLY]
thx for this 🙂

💬 [33] ja_pinkerton (3:20:16 PM)
but the sparks an jolts are mostly due to how effing clumsy I am

💬 [34] giacomo_tura (4:52:00 PM) [REPLY]
okk, i will try

💬 [35] giacomo_tura (4:52:09 PM)
thx for the explanation!

💬 [36] akumasaru (4:57:00 PM)
so what is the standard amperage of 5v?  If the arduino is outputting 5v, you need some sorta amps to power stuff, you can't just have voltage to light the LED?  Cause if I just set my power supply to 5.00v I get nothing without adjust a bit of amps?.

💬 [37] akumasaru (4:57:31 PM)


💬 [38] akumasaru (4:57:46 PM)
This isn't connected to the 5v source on the arduino by the way, this is from the wall.  Just using the arduino 5v as an example.

💬 [39] akumasaru (4:59:27 PM)
so I assume the LED is pulling .011a / 5.00v

💬 [40] akumasaru (5:00:21 PM)
I ask this cause I am allowed to adjust all 3 with this device.

💬 [41] akumasaru (5:01:11 PM)
like if this was a 9.00v battery, what would the amps be on that?

💬 [42] akumasaru (5:01:55 PM)
so what do you adjust to dim something, the Vs or the As?

💬 [43] diamonddback (5:02:04 PM) [REPLY]
When evaluating safety precautions, isolated exceptions do not define best practices.

Consider this scenario: Someone asks, "Should I use a parachute when jumping from a plane at 30,000 feet?"

A flawed response would be: "Technically, there was one person who jumped without a parachute and survived for almost four minutes, so you should be fine without one."

This reasoning ignores the overwhelming evidence supporting parachute use for survival. An outlier event should not override established safety principles.

So its mor or less usless in even stating this data.
Especial when it has allready been answered.

💬 [44] akumasaru (5:02:06 PM)
drop the 3.3v of course it dims

💬 [45] darwinwaswrong (5:02:46 PM) [REPLY]
Open on impact parachute ?

💬 [46] akumasaru (5:03:42 PM)
3.30v = 0.004a | 5.00v | 0.011a

💬 [47] diamonddback (5:04:29 PM) [REPLY]
eyeh thats not realy a fomula?

💬 [48] akumasaru (5:05:08 PM)
no, that's the output that the device gives me when hooking it up to the LED.  And setting it to 3.3v & 5.0v manually.

💬 [49] diamonddback (5:05:56 PM) [REPLY]
what device?

💬 [50] akumasaru (5:06:37 PM) [REPLY]
DSP-150 this one

💬 [51] diamonddback (5:06:42 PM)
Just look at the data sheat it should tell you.

💬 [52] diamonddback (5:07:34 PM)
well that would make no sence, as your not changing the resistor. at 5v you shoul use a different resistor then at 3.3 or at 9, or 12.

So my battery is 9V (9.3 v for the battery itself and it's rechargeable so it's fully charged)

After connecting it to my nano with various parts connected to arduino nano, i measure the voltage and it's 8.85V

Why is that the case? I vaguely understand that because multiple parts draws voltage and current might be the reason

💬 [2] ostenjoyer3103 (1:05:56 PM)
Guys when im done with arduino for the day, can I just unplug the arduino and other stuff with all the code still on there or do i have to first upload a blank sketch then unplug it?

💬 [3] akumasaru (1:08:59 PM) [REPLY]
Unplugging the Arduino just gives you power loss.  The code you have on there is not lost due to power loss.  So when you turn it on, it should still have your most current project code on it, and run those functions.  Unless something happened to the device or the reset button was pushed, etc.  It won't change code until you connect it to the IDE again and upload new/older code to the device.

💬 [4] ostenjoyer3103 (1:10:26 PM) [REPLY]
Im not worried about it wiping the code, im just asking can i damage the board by unplugging it while running a code and powering an led?

no

Okay thanks

💬 [7] toph2814 (1:13:23 PM) [REPLY]
🤔 what type of battery is it? it's possible that the battery doesn't have enough "juice"/current to power your NANO+attached components which is why its voltage is dropping *(thanks to Ohm's Law)*...

🎯 [8] toph2814 (1:14:28 PM) [REPLY]
yup... absolutely no worries about causing any damage... unlike PCs with operating systems, microcontrollers don't have the same pitfalls of sudden power loss which is why they're often used in appliances & other wearable electronics...

💬 [9] toph2814 (1:17:41 PM)
note that your 28BYJ-48 stepper motor is rated for __only 5V__! 
☝️ this is not a suggestion @gwn_boe ... it's what it is designed to handle... feeding it more than that voltage during operation would be unhealthy.

interesting... I wasn't aware there was a 12V variant *(of which you have)*

💬 [12] toph2814 (1:20:35 PM)
☝️ needless to say, it means you'll need to provide it with 12V for it to function @gwn_boe

💬 [13] toph2814 (1:21:30 PM)
*(naturally, you also need to connect the ULN2003 to a microcontroller or PWM source to make it function)*

💬 [14] enricopucci08242003 (2:35:24 PM) [REPLY]
nah it's able to power the components 

The components are 3 LEDs for the battery indicator and the "area" of the voltage divider composed of resistors

5V pin of the arduino to the 2 buttons
5V pin of the arduino to a module on the 5V pin of a module
5V pin of the arduino to the buzzer
5v pin of the arduino the 16x2 LCD

I am having trouble using 4 slaves on my arduino mega.
I made a bus for clock, MISO, MOSI and Reset pin using the SPI pins (just learned about that)
But now I dont now what pins I am supposed to use for my Save Select
Online I find that I only have pin 53 as slave select, but if I have multiple slave, how do I use it?

For now, I connected my slaves on pins 45 to 48 and weirdly, only two of my four slaves are working correctly

💬 [4] _wee_gee_ (1:19:27 PM) [REPLY]
> But now I dont now what pins I am supposed to use for my Save Select
If you're doing SPI, usually each individual slave has it's own separate SS pin.
You'd use any other general digital pin. Doesn't need to be PWM or anything fancy, just any pin that can be used as a digital pin.
Also, make sure you don't have multiple slave devices selected at once.

> I guess that's a hardware problem, but maybe I am coding something bad. What should I check?
Try each device individually with all others disconnected from the bus, with small snippets of example code that tests ONE slave device. If they work individually, then it's probably something with your code when running them all at the same time, likely selecting multiple devices at once.

💬 [5] browniezoulou (1:22:53 PM) [REPLY]
I have 3 out of 4 of my slaves working for some reason, I'll isolate the one not working to see what happen

The gentleman above suggested using a different library. Someone else suggested 2 MCU. ChatGPT suggested using an Interval Timer, which hasnt worked for me so far. Any suggestions from anyone who has come across this problem? The motor I'm using is a stepper motor

💬 [2] robherc (2:12:30 PM) [REPLY]
chatGPT advice is an excellent way to hopelessly ruin any project.

🎯 [3] robherc (2:13:10 PM)
Are you using hardware i2c, or bit-banging it for software i2c?

💬 [4] robherc (2:15:01 PM)
then where is the stuttering coming from? hardware peripherals don't interfere with the mcu-core

💬 [5] robherc (2:16:47 PM)
for the record, Marlin Firmware runs up to 5 stepper-drivers from a single arduino Mega 2560, along with up to 3 temperature-sensors, a 12864lcd, & 3 pwm outputs

💬 [6] robherc (2:17:49 PM)
(all while translating gcode & making PID updates to the PEM duty cycle %s, based on the gcode & calculated temperaturez)

💬 [1] otocotara (8:32:54 PM)
and back im,

im reading from a HCSR04, (using newping and the ping function (ping_timer)) but its tooooooooo slowwwwwwww (like, for real, it does at most 2 loops per second) how can i speed it up? (or push stuff to background idk i just need to read that fast 😭 )

💬 [2] otocotara (8:33:38 PM)
(my logic depends on at least 5 checks per second) btw async sonar did not work (i dunno why tho)

💬 [3] _wee_gee_ (8:36:31 PM)
without more info it's hard to tell what might be making the loop THAT slow.
If you've got something using `delay` or `pulseIn()` then there might be a timeout you should set differently

💬 [4] _wee_gee_ (8:37:21 PM)
and to +1 on what others were saying, there's no kernel interrupts (since there's no kernel/OS/whatever) on an Arduino (unless you write your own or use an RTOS or similar)
There ARE interrupts though, but you need to take care when using them

💬 [5] _wee_gee_ (8:37:52 PM)
interrupts cannot take so long that an interrupt interrupts it's own interrupt handler, for instance

💬 [6] otocotara (8:37:58 PM)
i basically copied and pasted a example, here it is: https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-new-ping/src/master/examples/NewPingEventTimer/NewPingEventTimer.ino

ig im trying to read it every loop, ima do some logic to dont read it until really really needed, but still its too slow 😦

💬 [7] _wee_gee_ (8:39:03 PM)
your code is this example verbatim?

💬 [8] _wee_gee_ (8:39:16 PM)
with no changes at all?

💬 [9] otocotara (8:39:43 PM)
basically none, but i decreased the checks per second (which should make it faster btw)

💬 [10] _wee_gee_ (8:40:18 PM)
"basically none" is not "none"; what code is running on the Arduino when you're seeing multiple seconds per check?

💬 [11] otocotara (8:41:39 PM)
the code is the same except ping_speed is a `#declare` and i update a variable insted of printing it to the serial

💬 [12] _wee_gee_ (8:42:40 PM) [REPLY]
how are you seeing the speed of the loop if you're only updating a variable?

💬 [13] otocotara (8:44:05 PM) [REPLY]
im printing to the serial in the main loop, not in the callback when the HCSR04 pings

💬 [14] otocotara (8:44:19 PM)
abt 2 logs per second at most

💬 [15] _wee_gee_ (8:44:48 PM)
you should just send your code; my next question is "what else is in `loop`"

💬 [16] _wee_gee_ (8:44:58 PM)
but that'd be answered by the code

💬 [17] _wee_gee_ (8:45:52 PM) [REPLY]
and a `#declare`, do you mean `#define`?

💬 [18] otocotara (8:46:17 PM)
i changed it a bit trying to optimize it but ig i just made it worse

💬 [19] otocotara (8:46:27 PM) [REPLY]
yep

💬 [20] otocotara (8:47:26 PM)
the check used to sit b4 the return to speed up the checks for the sensors, but i placed it in the only place its used (also removed the millis check as it would always be true)

💬 [21] _wee_gee_ (8:47:56 PM)
where is `stop()` defined?

💬 [23] otocotara (8:48:39 PM)
shouldnt take that long to just set 4 pins to low

💬 [24] otocotara (8:50:19 PM)
just realized i didnt reset changed_state to false in every loop, shouldnt impact that much either way

💬 [25] _wee_gee_ (9:00:37 PM) [REPLY]
`digitalWrite` is about as fast as a few thousand times per second minimum (there's a little overhead when doing `digitalWrite` instead of directly manipulating the port registers) so that's probably not the issue

You're using a lot of `#define`d constants; I'd suggest using
-`enum`s for the different states (so you just declare them all at once)
-`const int`s for anything that doesn't change during program execution (sidesteps the problem of `#define`s being just fancy find-and-replace that can have weird bugs if you're not used to looking for them)


On the actual code itself, I think `distance` not being `volatile` is probably causing one of your issues.
Since `distance` is being updated by `ping`, which I assume is being called via a timer interrupt somewhere within the `NewPing` library, you need to tell the compiler "always re-load this value from it's location in memory; never assume it's not changed between the last time you read it"

I still don't see how you're observing that the loop is too slow. 
State exactly what you SEE (or observe), and what you EXPECT to see, and how they're different

💬 [26] _wee_gee_ (9:03:05 PM)
`pulseIn` can also take a time-out as a parameter

💬 [27] _wee_gee_ (9:03:27 PM)
so you could use the typical ultrasonic sensor code but with a strict timeout that's not a full second (which is the default for `pulseIn`)

💬 [28] otocotara (9:04:03 PM)
i dont know how to tell the compiler distance is volatile, and i expected `#define` to be more performant than const int

i expected the robot to see that a sensor changed (fired) and instantly stop what ever its doing (it does that when its on attack mode for example (does not happen when in search mode)) after further investigation i realized the loop ran 2 times per second and probably missed the rapid firering of the sensors

💬 [29] darwinwaswrong (9:04:12 PM)
**I suggest you dont poll. Use interupts to detect sensor changes**

💬 [30] otocotara (9:04:23 PM)

pinchange

💬 [32] otocotara (9:05:36 PM) [REPLY]
pls elaborate

💬 [33] darwinwaswrong (9:06:15 PM)
What are the sensors ? bump switches ?

💬 [34] otocotara (9:07:35 PM)
no, i mean, there does not seem to be a `pinchange` function inside the arduino docs, and i never delt with interupts, so i dont know how to make it work

💬 [35] otocotara (9:09:43 PM)
can i even use interrupts with the ports im using for the sensors? do i need to place them on the ones who have the "~"? can i use analog ports? what does ISR stands for? why is it a block? where the list of all the blocks i can have?

💬 [36] darwinwaswrong (9:10:14 PM)
Hense the question re sensors

💬 [37] _wee_gee_ (9:10:17 PM)
> I don't know how to tell the compiler distance is volatile
it's standard C++, a google search should point you in the right direction too, but it's just `volatile int distance = -1;`; just a different kind of variable
>  i expected #define to be more performant than const int
the compiler's smarter than that. `const int` also lets the compiler check that you didn't make a mistake like using a `const unsigned int` where you wanted a `const int`
`const int` also makes it so you don't get weird order-of-operations thing happen like this:
```ino
#define MY_CONSTANT 6+7
void setup(){
  Serial.println(MY_CONSTANT*3);
}
```
this doesn't necessaily print `(6+7)*3`, it might print `6+(7*3)`
tl;dr the compiler is smart enough to strip out things like that and replace them with their equivalents.

If you don't believe me, [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) has a mode to compile code for Arduino boards etc. so you can see the assembly has no difference between `const`s and `#define`s

💬 [38] otocotara (9:11:13 PM)
i didnt knew that, thanks!

💬 [39] darwinwaswrong (9:12:15 PM) [REPLY]
distance isnt required to be a volatile - it is just a set variable in the code

💬 [40] _wee_gee_ (9:13:45 PM)
> and i never delt with interupts, so i dont know how to make it work
I thought you were asking earlier about kernel interrupts?
The general idea is you can have events call functions, "interrupting" the main loop. Very useful especially for things like this which need to respond quickly (or to unpredictable inputs)

💬 [41] otocotara (9:14:59 PM) [REPLY]
ik the concept but i never delt with it in real code

💬 [42] _wee_gee_ (9:18:45 PM) [REPLY]
```ino
//the code posted earlier defines this function
void ping() {
  if (sonar.check_timer()) {
    distance = sonar.ping_result;
  }
}
//then later in the code said function is passed as argument to a library function
    case SEARCH:
      changed_state = true;
      rotate_left_steap();
      sonar.ping_timer(ping);
      if (distance > 2) {
        current_mode = ATTACK;
      }
      distance = 0;
      break;
```
The library they're using has this as comments for the pingTimer method/function:
```ino
sonar.ping_timer(echoCheck); // Send out the ping, calls "echoCheck" function every 24uS where you can check the ping status.
```
it looks to me like it needs to be `volatile`?

💬 [43] _wee_gee_ (9:19:23 PM)
appears it's being updated during an interrupt

💬 [44] _wee_gee_ (9:21:31 PM) [REPLY]
@Bia it looks like you're never updating `ping_timer` in your code either, unlike the example posted here

💬 [45] _wee_gee_ (9:21:59 PM)
however

💬 [46] _wee_gee_ (9:22:30 PM)
the `pingTimer` in that example sketch is just the example `blink without delay` sketch with sunglasses on

💬 [47] otocotara (9:22:47 PM)
i dont think the interrupts work 😦

💬 [48] _wee_gee_ (9:23:15 PM)
it's checking  `millis` each loop to wait instead of using `delay` or similar

💬 [49] _wee_gee_ (9:23:35 PM) [REPLY]
I don't understand what you're saying here

💬 [50] _wee_gee_ (9:23:38 PM)

💬 [51] otocotara (9:23:53 PM)
oops, i ate a word there

💬 [52] _wee_gee_ (9:24:21 PM)
get the example you linked working on it's own first

💬 [53] _wee_gee_ (9:24:29 PM)
THEN try and incorporate it into your current overall sketch

💬 [54] otocotara (9:24:53 PM)
i defined all the interrupts like this:
```
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(FRONTAL_SENSOR),    frontal_sensor, CHANGE);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(LEFT_SENSOR),       left_sensor, CHANGE);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(RIGHT_SENSOR),      right_sensor, CHANGE);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(BACK_LEFT_SENSOR),  bleft_sensor, CHANGE);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(BACK_RIGHT_SENSOR), bright_sensor, CHANGE);
```

and no one triggers 😭 (all pins (should be) ~~are~~ digital)

💬 [55] _wee_gee_ (9:25:05 PM)
understand the example too first and foremost; what it's doing and what it's trying to do

💬 [56] otocotara (9:25:13 PM)
okidoki

🎯 [57] _wee_gee_ (9:26:05 PM) [REPLY]
`attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt())` etc. is more involved than just "this will automatically read an ultrasonic sensor for you"

💬 [58] otocotara (9:27:50 PM)
oh no, those are the infrared sensors, they just set a pin to LOW or HIGH

💬 [59] otocotara (9:28:21 PM)
the ultrasonic sensor is delt in the loop bcz slow

💬 [60] _wee_gee_ (9:28:29 PM)
all that `attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(pin), ISR, mode)` does for you is:
"When a `mode`-type signal change happens on `pin`, start `ISR` running so it can do something in response"

💬 [62] _wee_gee_ (9:28:57 PM)
if they're digital then that's probably fine then unless they send a lot of signals quickly

💬 [63] darwinwaswrong (9:29:21 PM)
That is an example of setting Port B to pinchange

💬 [64] otocotara (9:30:23 PM) [REPLY]
that is impressive, ima look into what exactly the code is doing, thanks!

💬 [65] darwinwaswrong (9:30:24 PM)
The use of the volatile keyword when a variable is changed by ISR routine

💬 [66] _wee_gee_ (9:31:27 PM) [REPLY]
there's no de-bounce on buttons going directly to an interrupt pin; this is not good practice from what I've heard

A bouncy switch could drive the mcu into interrupting-an-interrupt

💬 [67] darwinwaswrong (9:32:05 PM)
Please note - the pinchange fires off for any pin in the selected group of ports.
In the ISR, test for what fired off and set a variable to reflect that
In ISR's you have to get out as fast as possbile, dont serial print or do for lopps etc

💬 [68] _wee_gee_ (9:32:24 PM)
you'd need something like a set-reset or RC debounce on those buttons for this to work, since you can't debounce it in software when it's triggering an interrupt

💬 [69] darwinwaswrong (9:32:36 PM) [REPLY]
he is using sensors so no bounce - the example you can tune off bouncing on the switches

💬 [70] _wee_gee_ (9:32:59 PM)
if the sensors don't bounce then sure, yeah

💬 [71] otocotara (9:33:02 PM)
can i use `digitalRead` inside a ISR block?

💬 [72] darwinwaswrong (9:33:09 PM)
Yes

💬 [73] otocotara (9:33:13 PM)
okidoki

💬 [74] darwinwaswrong (9:33:22 PM)
Tha is how you deturmine what pin changed

💬 [75] _wee_gee_ (9:33:42 PM)
anything that happens "almost instantly"
anything that loops with `for` or `while` though, no
`Serial.print` for instance has loops inside it (not good)

💬 [76] darwinwaswrong (9:34:06 PM)
AS @WeeGee pointed out - if you use switches or noisy hardware - then debouncing is required.

💬 [77] kaito2112 (9:34:37 PM) [REPLY]
Aww. But I like using edge triggers to detect button clicks 😦

💬 [78] darwinwaswrong (9:35:07 PM)
Also note - Wokwi doesnt do analog so thats why slack me didnt put a resistor on the diode or power tot he sensor

💬 [79] _wee_gee_ (9:35:59 PM)
ISRs are "function that gets immediately called when an interrupt happens, pausing whatever else was happening at the time"; it's an Interrupt Service Routine

If however, an interrupt interrupts an ISR, then there's high chance for issues to arise, especially if you "pause" the ISR to... go do the ISR
eventually something will do unpredictable things

💬 [80] _wee_gee_ (9:36:35 PM)
-> you want to finish the ISR asap so that 
-the code being interrupted doesn't notice
-another interrupt won't happen while the ISR is still not done

💬 [81] _wee_gee_ (9:37:34 PM)
whenever you use an Arduino (at least an Uno) with the Arduino IDE, you have interrupts going "in the background" all the time; the interrupt that updates `millis` for you. 
It's so fast though that it barely registers unless you're doing microsecond-accurate work

💬 [82] _wee_gee_ (9:38:22 PM) [REPLY]
just use an R-C circuit on the thing and you should be fine; Arduino digital inputs are schmidt triggered (i.e. have hysteresis) anyways iirc

💬 [83] darwinwaswrong (9:39:15 PM)
You can just use a timer check in the ISR rather than increase the hardware complexity

💬 [84] darwinwaswrong (9:39:25 PM)
IMO

💬 [85] kaito2112 (9:39:25 PM) [REPLY]
I don't know what the last part of this means, but I'll look up the RC circuit values 😛 thank you

💬 [86] _wee_gee_ (9:39:51 PM) [REPLY]
hysteresis: it's got a different on-to-off threshold than off-to-on threshold

💬 [87] _wee_gee_ (9:39:59 PM)

No pinMode, it uses shift registers to control it, so no pinMode. everything initialised in the library.

🎯 [21] coder_do_as_impossible (10:57:12 AM) [REPLY]
Can you send a pic of which jumper are we talking. Generally that jumper is used to power Arduino using the external battery from the power terminal of the Shield.

💬 [22] coder_do_as_impossible (10:58:27 AM)
If you powering your arduino from USB, then remove it.

💬 [23] hasan_ghaith_ (10:58:59 AM)


💬 [24] hasan_ghaith_ (10:59:49 AM) [REPLY]
the arduino needs its own power supply?

i have 4 AA batteries plugged to the motor driver

💬 [26] coder_do_as_impossible (11:00:50 AM) [REPLY]
If you are powering your Arduino through the USB of your PC or smth, then remove it. If you want to power it using your battery pack itself, then don't remove it.

💬 [27] hasan_ghaith_ (11:01:36 AM) [REPLY]
okay i understand

💬 [28] hasan_ghaith_ (11:02:55 AM)
but does the Arduino need a separate power source than  whats connected to the motor driver shield?

Does the question **"After my brain surgery, should I attach another heart for it to run other than the heart running in my body?"** feels right?

**But while doing a open heart surgery, a mechanical heart is attached to keep the main organs running other than your original heart.**
` ` This is to properly repair your heart, and even if some failures occur, you should not die.

thank you so much

💬 [36] hasan_ghaith_ (11:08:59 AM)
i have an esp32 would it work with the arduino motor driver?

💬 [37] hasan_ghaith_ (11:09:50 AM)
because i may need the bluetooth and WiFi abilities that are in the esp32

💬 [38] hasan_ghaith_ (11:10:46 AM)
it is impossible?

💬 [39] coder_do_as_impossible (11:12:15 AM) [REPLY]
Its not impossible, but you can't use esp32 with the shield. You can clearly see both of those physical forms are different.

💬 [40] hasan_ghaith_ (11:14:24 AM)
i know that we cant attach them on top of each other and i know that the shield is designed to work on the Arduino but my friend bought it by mistake and i need to make it work with the esp32(if possible)

💬 [41] hasan_ghaith_ (11:15:06 AM)
using jumper wires to connect some pins to another

💬 [42] coder_do_as_impossible (11:15:50 AM) [REPLY]
You can buy something called as "Arduino Uno Wifi Rev2". It has both Wifi, and BLE

💬 [43] coder_do_as_impossible (11:16:16 AM)
Or else buy a Arduino Mega, and communicate between the ESP32 and Mega

💬 [44] hasan_ghaith_ (11:16:47 AM)
or buy a motor driver that can work on the esp32 which is cheaper?

💬 [45] coder_do_as_impossible (11:18:22 AM)
You can buy a L298N or a L293D motor driver. Not the shield and use it.

💬 [3] sean.4 (8:42:52 PM)
the USB connectivity itself is working already, it's just a matter of getting the USB Serial driver to work with the specific USB interface/endpoints or writing a custom USB driver

Looks like you can use AT commands based on a quick search online.

well yes I can, if I use Linux it'll work instantly since Quectel provides drivers

💬 [6] sean.4 (8:44:13 PM)
but normal USB Serial won't connect to the devices since they advertise themselves as a "vendor-specific" device

Hi Everyone. 
I really need help, if someone can support me it would be grate. 

I'm trying to upload a script to a Arduino Nano / ATmega328PB / CH430 Chip. USB-C model. But no sucsses.

On a PC I have Arduino IDE 2.3.6 version, with installed minicore.
Device manager detects the board as: USB-SERIAL CH430 (COM2)

In Arduino IDE, under Tools:
- Board/MiniCore/ATmega328
- Port/COM2
- Board rate: Default
- BOD/BOD2.7
- Bootloader/YES (UART0) // also i tried (UART1)
- Cloak: External 16Mhz
- Eprom: Eprom retained 
- Compiler LTO/ LTO enabled // alsp tried disabled
- Variant/ 328PB
- Programer: Arduino as ISP

And I always get errors. 
The LED on the Arduino are continuously glowing, TX and POW. Nothing is blinking. 

What am i doing work?

💬 [2] tuulikauri (3:49:51 PM) [REPLY]
What are the errors? And are you clicking Upload? The arrow.

💬 [3] tuulikauri (3:52:14 PM)
If no LEDs flash, I would propose that you arent sending any data to COM2.

💬 [4] patrick_2144 (3:55:48 PM) [REPLY]
you may need to flash the bootloader on it first if you are using MiniCore

💬 [5] patrick_2144 (3:56:45 PM) [REPLY]
have you tried using the default Arduino Nano board setting like shown here? @McDid'lleyDoo

💬 [6] mr.twixy. (4:21:03 PM) [REPLY]
I'm trying to Burn the bootloader. 
Yes i allso tryed with Arduino NANO and after clicking burn bootlaoder i get a notification "burning bootloader" and that's it. 
LEDs are not flashing, and after 20 min, nothing happend. the same massage is stil there.

💬 [7] mr.twixy. (4:21:36 PM) [REPLY]
Yes, no result.

💬 [8] patrick_2144 (4:22:01 PM) [REPLY]
you tried uploading for that, not burning the bootloader right

💬 [9] mr.twixy. (4:22:38 PM)
i tryed uploading, and burning the bootloader. same thing.

💬 [10] mr.twixy. (4:22:46 PM)
nothing is happeining.

💬 [11] patrick_2144 (4:23:15 PM)
I think Tuuli is right about a connection problem

💬 [12] tuulikauri (4:24:27 PM) [REPLY]
Using what as your ISP? Do you have another arduino?

💬 [13] patrick_2144 (4:25:01 PM)
with the board connected with a cable, can you click the board selection tab and see if any com ports show up?

💬 [14] mr.twixy. (4:25:07 PM) [REPLY]
No, i just hawe a connected arduino board on that i would like to upload a script

💬 [15] mr.twixy. (4:25:28 PM)

💬 [18] mr.twixy. (4:26:47 PM) [REPLY]


💬 [19] tuulikauri (4:27:03 PM)
Alright. If your board's bootloader is messed up, you wont be able to load Blink sketch on it. But lets try that first 🙂

💬 [20] mr.twixy. (4:27:06 PM)
and in the device manager is also the samo port on the arduino

Whats this MiniCore thing? Do they need to uninstall it to disable it?

💬 [23] mr.twixy. (4:29:49 PM) [REPLY]
ok i got that open. Witch setting should i use? 
Arduino NANO, or I just leave minicore/atmega328?

💬 [24] mr.twixy. (4:30:15 PM) [REPLY]
That is just a list of boards that i can select.

💬 [25] patrick_2144 (4:30:18 PM) [REPLY]
MiniCore is a boards package for some of the ATmega chips

💬 [26] patrick_2144 (4:31:18 PM)
so he can choose a different board like the Arduino Nano instead of using one of the "boards" MiniCore has

💬 [27] tuulikauri (4:31:40 PM) [REPLY]
Try with Arduino Nano as your board first.

💬 [28] mr.twixy. (4:31:40 PM)
ok ill select arduino nano

💬 [29] tuulikauri (4:32:46 PM)
Also if it doesnt work still... Did you or anyone else burn a bootloader? Is this a knockoff board, or a real one from arduino.cc store?

💬 [30] mr.twixy. (4:33:03 PM) [REPLY]
Ok Arduino Nano is selected. 
Under Processores i have just 328P / 328P old bootloader and 168

💬 [31] tuulikauri (4:33:27 PM) [REPLY]
Ignore all that. You only need to select the board and com port. The other settings are for using an ISP.

💬 [32] mr.twixy. (4:33:43 PM) [REPLY]
I just unpacked it and connected it to the PC. It is a aliexpress board

💬 [33] tuulikauri (4:34:15 PM) [REPLY]
Ok. Theres a chance then that it doesnt come ready-to-go out of the box, like a real one would.

🎯 [34] tuulikauri (4:35:45 PM) [REPLY]
`Device manager detects the board as: USB-SERIAL CH430 (COM2)` and in IDE. So cable should be ok...

💬 [35] tuulikauri (4:36:21 PM) [REPLY]
So when you click Upload, after selecting Nano and Com2 as your board and port, what happens?

eeeeeeeee im not sure what that means xD

💬 [46] tuulikauri (4:42:23 PM) [REPLY]
Heh its ok. 

Plug it back in. Hold the reset button and click Upload; keep holding. Once the Compiling popup changes to Uploading (might be very fast / too fast to see) release the reset button.

💬 [47] mr.twixy. (4:45:54 PM)
same thing... Uploading / like frozen , the 2 LED´s glowing

💬 [48] mr.twixy. (4:46:27 PM)
The board is probably FUxxed up

💬 [49] tuulikauri (4:47:17 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah. Its not tooooo bad since Windows still sees it. So the comms port chip is working. But you might have a bad bootloader, and need to reburn it. Which you would need another board for, and isnt recommended as a beginner task.

💬 [74] patrick_2144 (5:31:25 PM) [REPLY]
you are begging people to help you as well as cross-posting

💬 [75] patrick_2144 (5:31:42 PM)
If you want people to help you, you have to be respectful.

💬 [76] jonsimard (5:32:45 PM) [REPLY]
Respectfully, I just asked

💬 [77] tuulikauri (5:33:03 PM) [REPLY]
This is basically it. If you are patient and helpful to people trying to help YOU, there are lots of helpful kind people here. There's just some etiquette you aren't following which is giving you bad reactions.

💬 [78] tuulikauri (5:34:22 PM)
But here's some help. https://discord.com/channels/420594746990526466/1393373772072878110 Read down this thread to the part where I helped a newbie figure out what information to share.

💬 [1] _bonkman_ (9:32:00 AM)
can supplying the nrf24l01+PA+LNA module (115mA transmission current) with the arduino uno's 3v3 (50mA max output) be the reason for its low range?

💬 [2] dolce_st. (9:35:12 AM) [REPLY]
did you set the transmission power in the code

💬 [3] dolce_st. (9:35:26 AM)
nrf can only run at 3.6v at most

💬 [4] dolce_st. (9:35:33 AM)
3.3v is normal

💬 [5] _bonkman_ (9:35:34 AM)
RF24_PA_MAX

💬 [6] dolce_st. (9:35:44 AM) [REPLY]
and how is it 50ma

💬 [7] dolce_st. (9:36:06 AM)
the uno has ams1117, 800ma max

💬 [8] _bonkman_ (9:36:20 AM)
really?

💬 [9] dolce_st. (9:36:37 AM)
yes

💬 [10] _bonkman_ (9:36:44 AM)
i revised the code and found my prolem (i wrote rf24_PA_MIn)

💬 [11] dolce_st. (9:36:51 AM)
lol

💬 [12] _bonkman_ (9:37:01 AM)
but does the nano have the same regulator for 3v3?

💬 [13] dolce_st. (9:37:06 AM)
100mw can get you like 2km line of sight

💬 [14] dolce_st. (9:37:11 AM) [REPLY]
yes

💬 [15] dolce_st. (9:37:16 AM)
nano also has a regulator

💬 [16] _bonkman_ (9:37:39 AM)
because all of the forums tell that the 3v3 is connected to the ftdi and can only deliver 50mA

💬 [17] dolce_st. (9:37:42 AM)
nano clone has an ams1117, you would mostly find clones online

💬 [18] _bonkman_ (9:37:45 AM)
is this old information

💬 [19] _bonkman_ (9:37:55 AM)
and i'm using original arduions

💬 [20] dolce_st. (9:38:05 AM) [REPLY]
50ma sounds like max current from a gpio pin

💬 [21] dolce_st. (9:38:30 AM)
the onboard regulator delivers 800ma @ 3.3v max

💬 [22] dolce_st. (9:39:10 AM) [REPLY]
still the same

💬 [23] _bonkman_ (9:40:05 AM)
damn... i always read that 3v3 in arduinos suck for nrf24l01+PA+LNA because they only deliver a max current of 50mA, and that nrf24s always need a seperate powersupply

💬 [24] dolce_st. (9:40:13 AM)
also set your channel to not overlap 2.4ghz wifi

💬 [25] dolce_st. (9:40:35 AM) [REPLY]
i hooked that up to my nano just fine

💬 [26] _bonkman_ (9:40:49 AM)
did it get you full range?

💬 [27] dolce_st. (9:41:36 AM)
idk, the farthest ive placed them was like 50m, it was a water level sensor transmitter

💬 [28] dolce_st. (9:41:46 AM)
transmission is fine

💬 [29] diamonddback (9:42:24 AM)
@bonk man  bonk your correct. 
@dolce_st Your mestaken.

💬 [30] dolce_st. (9:43:00 AM) [REPLY]
how so?

💬 [31] dolce_st. (9:43:04 AM)
3.3v thing?

💬 [32] diamonddback (9:43:16 AM)
Correct.

💬 [33] dolce_st. (9:43:25 AM)
oh wait 3.3v comes from ch340

💬 [34] _bonkman_ (9:43:33 AM)
exactly

💬 [35] dolce_st. (9:43:46 AM)
mine has a 3.3v regulator

💬 [36] dolce_st. (9:43:50 AM)
so i assumed

💬 [37] diamonddback (9:44:09 AM)
And your still incorrect. @dolce_st

💬 [39] dolce_st. (9:44:30 AM) [REPLY]
enlighten me

🎯 [40] _bonkman_ (9:44:56 AM)
@DaDev idk how but i left the transmitter drawing current from the uno for like 18+ hours accidentally, and the ftdi was still working then as i uploaded the code fine, does the ftdi has an internal security system that shuts it down when its overheating?

💬 [41] dolce_st. (9:45:33 AM)
i doubt the ftdi has thermal protection

💬 [42] _bonkman_ (9:45:45 AM)
then how did it survive?

💬 [43] diamonddback (9:46:34 AM)
@dolce_st There are two reagulators a 1117 and a 3.3v the 3.3v is normaly maxed at 150ma. The areduino will use 50 ish ma. Leaving 100ma max. But it will not ever support that so we generaly say 50ma usable power safely

💬 [44] _bonkman_ (9:46:36 AM)
voltage sag maybe

💬 [45] diamonddback (9:47:22 AM)
@bonk man oh it can. Normally brown out is the sideffect

💬 [46] dolce_st. (9:47:29 AM) [REPLY]
the sot-23-5 ldo?

💬 [47] dolce_st. (9:47:45 AM)
ic

💬 [48] _bonkman_ (9:47:45 AM)
what's a brownout @DaDev ? i hear this term alot

💬 [49] dolce_st. (9:48:03 AM)
temporary voltage drop below operating level

💬 [50] _bonkman_ (9:48:28 AM)
hmm i see the problem now

💬 [51] dolce_st. (9:48:36 AM)
not power loss

💬 [52] dolce_st. (9:48:57 AM)
you draw too much current and voltage drops

💬 [53] _bonkman_ (9:49:02 AM)
yeah

💬 [54] _bonkman_ (9:49:42 AM)
so i technically need a seperate powersupply. i'll use an ams117-3v3 module maybe

💬 [55] dolce_st. (9:50:07 AM)
just make sure you have a constant 5v power supply

💬 [56] _bonkman_ (9:50:14 AM)
oh btw @DaDev i bought new servos and turned out it was really a bad brand, those 8 fried servos xDD

💬 [57] dolce_st. (9:50:17 AM)
ams1117 has 1v dropout voltage

💬 [58] _bonkman_ (9:50:46 AM) [REPLY]
i'll power the ams117 with 7.6v, as i have the power source from my pcb

💬 [59] dolce_st. (9:51:01 AM)
alright

💬 [60] _bonkman_ (9:51:39 AM) [REPLY]
the new bought servo was being supplied fine and it worked, they scammed me xD

💬 [61] _bonkman_ (9:54:33 AM)
@DaDev can i use the uno's 3v3 only for the nrf24l01+PA+LNA in reception mode?

💬 [62] _bonkman_ (9:54:39 AM)
only for the module but nothing else

💬 [63] _bonkman_ (9:54:53 AM)
as i read it consumes max 45mA in reception mode

💬 [64] _bonkman_ (9:55:17 AM)
noice

💬 [65] _bonkman_ (9:56:12 AM)
nah the communication isnt bidirectional, lucky me xD

💬 [66] _bonkman_ (9:56:37 AM)
because bidirectional communcation requires the receiver to transmit also, right?

💬 [67] _bonkman_ (9:56:55 AM)
which isnt my case tho its only designed for reception

Yellow is the 3.3v reg. 
Purple is the 5v reg.

💬 [2] diamonddback (10:04:01 AM)
This is the arduino its self

💬 [3] diamonddback (10:06:10 AM)
Correct max

💬 [4] diamonddback (10:06:50 AM)
Well the arduino is useing 50ma off the top

💬 [5] diamonddback (10:07:29 AM)
Right.

💬 [6] diamonddback (10:07:50 AM)
And that adds up.
150x0.8=

💬 [7] diamonddback (10:09:06 AM)
Thats usable power. So 120-50 leaves us with around 70ma to play with

💬 [8] diamonddback (10:09:21 AM)
50 would be safe

💬 [9] diamonddback (10:10:26 AM)
Any time your calculating for power you want to calculate with a MINIMUM  of 20% overhead.

💬 [10] diamonddback (10:11:01 AM)
If its Chinese products doubble it so 40

💬 [11] diamonddback (10:11:36 AM)
50ma the arduino is useing

💬 [12] diamonddback (10:11:54 AM)
And everything else

💬 [13] diamonddback (10:12:50 AM)
The 3.3v pins is not for real use. Nor is the 5v pin. Its not realy for an OUTPUT.

💬 [14] diamonddback (10:13:03 AM)
They are inputs.

💬 [15] diamonddback (10:16:15 AM)
When your providing stable voltage. No.
And what if your doing somethin that's requiring more then 150ma on the 3.3v line. You supply it with the exturnal 3.3v line

💬 [16] diamonddback (10:17:43 AM)
Think of a pc mother board... if you provide the 5v line with 4.5v the pc restarts. 
5.5v the pc restarts..

Its up to YOU to make sure the 5v rail is stable

💬 [17] _bonkman_ (10:21:07 AM)
so a tiny difference, say 0.02 ± won't really cause harm to the uno?

💬 [18] _bonkman_ (10:22:04 AM) [REPLY]
because if this is correct, then i'm planning to plug the regulator module to the pcb instead of the module

🎯 [19] _bonkman_ (10:22:32 AM)

💬 [1] anonengineering (9:13:57 PM)
you mean physically? 
you'll likely need to rearrange what you have there to make room for the buzzer

💬 [2] darkzwy (9:15:23 PM) [REPLY]
yes, phisically

💬 [3] anonengineering (9:16:21 PM)
if you move the button down you could fit a buzzer, idk how big your "speaker" is
the LED will fit up top

💬 [4] darkzwy (9:23:33 PM) [REPLY]
There u have the project itself, buzzer and led

💬 [5] anonengineering (9:26:27 PM) [REPLY]
forgot the buzzer 🙂

💬 [6] darkzwy (9:28:35 PM) [REPLY]
wow, appreciate it, thank u. I will rearrange everything

💬 [7] darkzwy (11:20:01 PM) [REPLY]
This is how it end up looking, still need to connect the buzzer and the other 3 max7219

💬 [8] darkzwy (11:21:45 PM) [REPLY]
How do I make sure the buzzer is well connected? Maybe the pins are too short? Idk

💬 [9] anonengineering (11:21:56 PM)
the LED needs a ground, otherwise looks good

💬 [10] darkzwy (11:22:51 PM) [REPLY]
The ground is the one u connected to the negative?

💬 [11] darkzwy (11:23:19 PM)

💬 [12] anonengineering (11:24:30 PM)
is one lead in 27?

💬 [13] anonengineering (11:25:04 PM)


💬 [14] darkzwy (11:25:05 PM) [REPLY]
yup, the larger one

💬 [15] anonengineering (11:25:59 PM)
what is it connected to?

💬 [16] darkzwy (11:29:17 PM) [REPLY]
what do u mean? I don't understand 😭

💬 [17] darkzwy (11:29:39 PM)
Here’s another pic

💬 [18] anonengineering (11:30:51 PM)
ok, i see it now, nvm
but do pay heed to Tophs comment, an Uno can only supply so much current

💬 [19] darkzwy (11:31:30 PM)
so... I should do it with only 1 max7219?

💬 [20] darkzwy (11:31:37 PM)
like it's in the pic?

💬 [21] anonengineering (11:32:33 PM)
you are limited to only a few hundred mA of current out of the Uno, depends on how much each display will draw

💬 [22] darkzwy (11:34:17 PM) [REPLY]
wanna see the idea I had? I got it from a link

💬 [23] darkzwy (11:34:26 PM)
I mean the game

💬 [24] darkzwy (11:35:06 PM)
I don't know if it affects , but when I went to buy the max7219 I was told that I should just put them together and that it would be the same

💬 [25] anonengineering (11:36:15 PM)
picture having 1 dot on, it draws X current. now light up all the dots, it draws 64X current

💬 [26] toph2814 (11:37:15 PM)
⚠️ ...and more MAX7219 matrices would mean even more LEDs lit up & more current required *(which will likely overload your Arduino eventually & cause damage)*

💬 [27] darkzwy (11:37:42 PM) [REPLY]
oh... ok, gotchu

💬 [28] anonengineering (11:37:55 PM)
now for say Snake, it may not be that many dots, but you should design for worst case

💬 [29] darkzwy (11:38:50 PM)
this is my game idea

💬 [30] anonengineering (11:39:09 PM) [REPLY]
if you power the displays with a seperate 1 or 2 amp supply this is true

💬 [31] anonengineering (11:40:47 PM)
you can also set the brightness to a low value while you experiment, this reduces current

💬 [32] toph2814 (11:41:01 PM)
🤓 remember that many YT & online "guides"/"tutorials" don't really need to run their projects for very long... they are just in it for clicks & views so they don't take into consideration how to wire things properly ... unlike less popular but very good resources out there that teach you how to protect your components...

💬 [33] darkzwy (11:41:50 PM) [REPLY]
that's true, understand it

💬 [34] toph2814 (11:42:37 PM)
👉 so although "YES", you can buy more MAX7219 matrices & daisy chain them together... you should __ALWAYS__ power them with a separate 5V power source & not draw power through your Arduino board.

💬 [35] darkzwy (11:42:42 PM) [REPLY]
this is my final semester project, I don't got that much "time" to experiment :(. During the semester teacher taught us nothing about arduino

💬 [36] toph2814 (11:43:02 PM)
it's a common occurance 😓

💬 [37] anonengineering (11:43:08 PM)
and while powered by USB the port on your PC will (hopefully) limit current for the whole project to 500mA. don't want to damage the PC port 😉

💬 [38] toph2814 (11:43:35 PM)
*(which is possible to do)*

💬 [39] darkzwy (11:44:10 PM)
okok, so your "final recommendation" is to leave it like I have it now? only 1 max7219?

💬 [40] toph2814 (11:45:05 PM)
again... my recommendation is to add a separate 5V power source to power the MAX7219 matrix... *(at least if you care about your Arduino UNO board 🤷)*

💬 [41] anonengineering (11:46:19 PM)
as I read it "all segments on" draws about 350mA

💬 [42] darkzwy (11:47:09 PM) [REPLY]
is that good or bad? 😭

💬 [43] anonengineering (11:47:51 PM)
it's pushing the limit, the USB also has to supply power to everything else (like the Uno itself)

💬 [44] darkzwy (11:49:11 PM) [REPLY]
u mean connect this and the usb type b to the arduino?

💬 [45] anonengineering (11:49:52 PM)
that 5v could power the display itself, then USB current draw would be low

💬 [46] darkzwy (11:50:17 PM)
nice, I'll try to get that

💬 [47] anonengineering (11:50:30 PM)
assuming that is a 1 or 2 amp 5v supply

💬 [48] darkzwy (11:51:22 PM)
okok

💬 [49] darkzwy (11:51:39 PM) [REPLY]
with that I can now connect my 4 matrices without any problems?

💬 [50] anonengineering (11:52:38 PM)
also useful for projects that involve small motors, or any thing that draws considerable current. An Uno can *control* a building elevator, it can't *power* one.

💬 [51] anonengineering (11:53:10 PM)
4 x 350mA = 1400 mA

💬 [52] anonengineering (11:56:20 PM)
you could use a 100 amp power supply (it would be overkill here), the circuit draws what it needs

💬 [53] darkzwy (11:57:41 PM)
I'm bit confused now about the amp and the 5v power supply @Toph mentioned

💬 [54] anonengineering (11:58:23 PM)
the LED matrix needs sufficient power
power = volts X amps

💬 [55] anonengineering (11:59:37 PM)
so if you need 1.4 amps, you are better off with a 2 amps supply, 1 amp isn't enough

💬 [56] darkzwy (12:02:12 AM)
so... I need a 5v 2a power supply?

💬 [57] anonengineering (12:02:31 AM)
to be "in spec", yes

💬 [58] anonengineering (12:04:00 AM)
or maybe you want to add more matrices, then a bigger supply (which would still work for fewer matrices)

💬 [59] darkzwy (12:05:12 AM) [REPLY]
no, my goal is 4 matrices if it's possible. Otherwise, I would work with only 1 matrix

💬 [60] anonengineering (12:07:01 AM)
here is a large example, "Vcc" and ground represent the external supply
<https://wokwi.com/projects/437149578488400897>

💬 [61] darkzwy (12:08:23 AM)
nice, I'll check it

💬 [62] anonengineering (12:08:57 AM)
in short, your idea is perfectly doable, with proper power management

got it

💬 [64] darkzwy (12:09:43 AM)
do u guys know about the arduino codes? the link had one but I suppose I need to change it

💬 [65] darkzwy (12:09:44 AM)
idk

💬 [66] anonengineering (12:10:57 AM)
if it works...🤷‍♂️ 
usually you change a parameter to tell the code how many matrices are being used

💬 [67] darkzwy (12:12:03 AM) [REPLY]
that's the problem... idk if it works lol

💬 [68] darkzwy (12:12:38 AM)

yup, like I can't insert it correctly on the breadboard

💬 [79] tuulikauri (11:51:54 PM) [REPLY]
Hard to tell the scale, but perhaps its too thin to get grabbed by the board's springs.

💬 [80] darkzwy (11:53:15 PM) [REPLY]
what should I do?

💬 [81] was_ted (11:55:11 PM)
Are you powering something via the breadboard that needs 5v2A?

💬 [82] darkzwy (11:55:53 PM) [REPLY]
the 4 max7219 matrices

💬 [83] tuulikauri (11:56:18 PM) [REPLY]
Depends whats going on. Its very thin and short, and falling out because its hitting the insulation and not going in very far?

💬 [84] tuulikauri (11:56:42 PM)
Or is the buzzer dangling and pulling it out?

💬 [85] tuulikauri (11:56:57 PM)
Or is the wire stiff and acting like a spring to pull itself out?

💬 [86] tuulikauri (11:57:15 PM)
If its the last two, a piece of masking tape to hold your prototype together can go a long way 😄

💬 [87] tuulikauri (12:00:07 AM)
If its actually that the wire is very tiny and loose, you can strip the insulation off until you have about 1.5 cm bare wire, fold the end on itself and twist it together so its one thicker piece of bare wire. If you do that with 22 AWG wire though, it will be too thick to go in the breadboard.

💬 [88] darkzwy (12:01:34 AM) [REPLY]
this one, isn't going very far down the protoboard

💬 [89] darkzwy (12:02:14 AM)
the cable gets off after I try to connect it

💬 [90] tuulikauri (12:02:46 AM) [REPLY]
You can carefully remove some more insulation until there's at least 6mm of bare wire; the same length as your male pins.

💬 [91] darkzwy (12:03:10 AM)
ok, I'll try to do that brb

There's specific tools for stripping wire safely / evenly - those are $$ though 🙂

💬 [96] darkzwy (12:04:47 AM) [REPLY]

💬 [98] tuulikauri (12:05:11 AM)
You can use scissors or an exacto knife carefully. Teeth work really well and are REALLY not recommended.

💬 [99] tuulikauri (12:05:27 AM)
Unless you like dental bills. 🤣

💬 [100] tuulikauri (12:06:36 AM)
Pliers can work too. You can grip the insulation in one pair and the wire in another and pull gently.

💬 [101] tuulikauri (12:08:55 AM) [REPLY]
I have 8 of them 🙂

💬 [102] tuulikauri (12:09:22 AM)
They're very common on music gear. K, come pick it up. Its in Toronto.

💬 [103] tuulikauri (12:11:55 AM) [REPLY]
I do.

💬 [104] tuulikauri (12:12:18 AM) [REPLY]
Let me guess...

💬 [105] tuulikauri (12:13:09 AM) [REPLY]
You want me to confirm this wiring? https://forum.arduino.cc/t/usb-d-d/439550 😄

💬 [106] tuulikauri (12:16:29 AM) [REPLY]
This says it might be complicated https://www.keebtalk.com/t/change-usb-connector-type/12822/10

From the official russian electronics information website... Pinterest 😅 https://www.pinterest.com/pin/54465476738732257/

Wikipedia says... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware

💬 [111] tuulikauri (12:25:40 AM)
Youll note the wikipedia end-on plug pic matches the male russian pinterest pic... So. Yeah. This is accurate for the male (cable.. plug) end on (looking into the cable) pin order.

💬 [112] darkzwy (12:25:46 AM)
Think I got it

💬 [113] tuulikauri (12:26:13 AM) [REPLY]
Looks good, good enough for a buzzer anyways! Does it stay in the board?

💬 [114] darkzwy (12:26:23 AM)
I'll try

💬 [115] darkzwy (12:29:09 AM)
Well… I guess it stays on the board lol

💬 [116] darkzwy (12:29:48 AM)


💬 [117] tuulikauri (12:31:06 AM) [REPLY]
Good enough for a prototype! If you cant get them in further to cover the bare wires, you can trim 1mm off them; or just be careful not to short against them with other bare wires

💬 [118] tuulikauri (12:32:44 AM)
If you trim them, immediately throw out the short copper wires - those little bits have a tendancy to wind up on your microcontroller shorting something 😅

💬 [119] darkzwy (12:36:35 AM) [REPLY]
I managed to get them further

💬 [120] mercury_woman (8:18:20 AM) [REPLY]
green and white is not universally agreed and it pisses me off

💬 [121] darkzwy (11:16:54 AM) [REPLY]
Hi, I finished all and loaded the code. The max7219s aren’t working as expected, all the matrices and all the led dots are on while running the code, everything else “seems” right

💬 [122] darkzwy (11:17:48 AM)


💬 [123] darkzwy (11:18:24 AM)
Can someone help me to review my code or something? It’s a very extensive code 😦

im doing a research on making a landslide detection device and i want to know what some good budget sensors, I'm looking for:

-MPU-6050
-soil moisture sensor
-Temperature and humidity sensor
-waterflow sensor

💬 [2] dolce_st. (8:07:31 AM) [REPLY]
what type of water flow sensor

💬 [3] dolce_st. (8:07:42 AM)
contactless or inline?

💬 [4] dolce_st. (8:08:02 AM)
you can use dht22 for temp and humidity

💬 [5] dolce_st. (8:08:14 AM)
ass accuracy but cheap

💬 [6] dolce_st. (8:08:33 AM)
or aht20/aht30

inline

💬 [9] alfy00 (8:44:19 AM)
hey! so I was just wondering how I could change an arduino's variables in real time?

💬 [10] alfy00 (8:44:32 AM)
as an example, I have an arduino uno and a few LEDs attached to it

💬 [11] alfy00 (8:44:47 AM)
is there a way to make it so I can turn the LEDs on via PC?

💬 [12] rammaster0216 (8:44:52 AM) [REPLY]
on the web? or from serial?

💬 [13] alfy00 (8:45:14 AM)
maybe create a visual studio winforms app to control the lights?

💬 [14] alfy00 (8:45:24 AM) [REPLY]
idk honestly the difference

💬 [15] rammaster0216 (8:45:31 AM) [REPLY]
serial is local

💬 [16] alfy00 (8:45:31 AM)
probably from serial

💬 [17] rammaster0216 (8:45:47 AM)
its how you usually upload

💬 [18] rammaster0216 (8:45:52 AM)
web is wifi

💬 [19] alfy00 (8:45:56 AM)
dont i need a wifi protector or whatever to use web yea

💬 [20] rammaster0216 (8:46:05 AM)
what board do you have

💬 [21] alfy00 (8:46:06 AM)
so i guess serial

💬 [22] rammaster0216 (8:46:09 AM)
some have wifi built in

💬 [23] alfy00 (8:46:14 AM)
I have an Arduino UNO

thats not an uno

💬 [36] alfy00 (8:48:02 AM)
thats what the packaging says tho?

💬 [37] rammaster0216 (8:48:11 AM)
i think thats a minima copy perchance

💬 [38] alfy00 (8:48:14 AM)
and when I connected it to the IDE it detected it

💬 [39] rammaster0216 (8:48:29 AM)
no wifi sadly

oh?

💬 [41] rammaster0216 (8:48:32 AM)
so serial it is

thats fine

💬 [43] alfy00 (8:48:44 AM)
i bought it from a local store for like 10 dollars

💬 [44] alfy00 (8:48:51 AM)
so im not surprised

💬 [1] toph2814 (11:27:54 PM)
🤔 perhaps consider using a *Pro Micro*  or *RP2040*  based board *(like the `Arduino NANO RP2040 Connect`)*  which are both popular choices for custom HID keyboards & controllers...

💬 [2] toph2814 (11:30:12 PM)
*( 🤷 you'll need to do a bit of digging regarding that... but I haven't heard as many issues with the Pro Micro as compared to the Leonardo for HID applications)*

💬 [3] toph2814 (11:32:55 PM)
it's a great board but it's "too new" for my taste... vs other older boards which are more widely supported

💬 [4] toph2814 (11:33:35 PM)
you could buy some boards with presoldered headers

💬 [5] toph2814 (11:37:19 PM)
yup... they did though I haven't seen them on sale lately...

💬 [6] toph2814 (11:40:06 PM)
might be worth investing in a good soldering iron & learning a very useful skill for tinkering

💬 [7] toph2814 (11:42:43 PM) [REPLY]
roughly $30ish for a *Pinecil V2 (or V1)*  but that doesn't come with a power supply *(you'll need around 65W or better)*

💬 [8] toph2814 (11:43:31 PM)
*(they can be that high for branded smart irons like `Hakko` or `Weller`)*

💬 [9] toph2814 (11:44:03 PM)
*the key is that they need proper internal PID temperature control*

💬 [10] toph2814 (11:46:50 PM)
also understand that there is a massive size difference between an `Arduino R4 Minima` vs other boards *(like the Pro Micro, NANO, & the stamp-sized boards that are gaining popularity)* ... which makes the smaller form factor of other boards more attractive for portable HID controllers

💬 [11] toph2814 (11:47:57 PM)
again, depends on what you're actually building 😉

💬 [12] toph2814 (11:49:05 PM)
one big advantage of larger boards are their available GPIO pins 🤓 but that can be mitigated by shift registers & I²C port expanders

💬 [13] toph2814 (11:50:33 PM)
or course...

🎯 [14] toph2814 (11:54:01 PM)
👉 HID is a standard for computer peripherals...
👉 Arduino is an ecosystem *(board + IDE + libraries)*  that allow you to create microcontroller projects relatively easily...

🎯 [15] toph2814 (11:55:19 PM)
🤓 so any microcontroller board that is "HID compliant" can be made into an HID peripheral by using the appropriate libraries that allow it to communicate with the computer it's attached to via USB...

🎯 [16] toph2814 (11:55:32 PM)
*(aka the "firmware")*

💬 [17] toph2814 (11:57:29 PM)
then unless you're simply copying an existing HID controller project, then building a car SIM controller from scratch is fairly intermediate to advanced

haven't really looked into `Hoodloader2` myself but as it will be messing/reprogramming the onboard chip to force an UNO into HID compliance, I definitely wouldn't recommend it... *(specially since there are plenty of comparatively low cost out of the box HID compliant boards out there)*

💬 [20] toph2814 (12:02:24 AM)
👉 as a beginner, I'd recommend following the guide to the letter *(with the board they specifically used)* ... then you'll hope it's a good guide *(at least one who's not faking their results; if it's a guide that tells you to use `Hoodloader2` then I'd look for a different one)*

💬 [21] toph2814 (12:04:54 AM)
again. I don't condone this practice *(relying on generative AI or forcing an UNO to a task it wasn't meant for)*  so if that's the path you wish to go with... all I can say is good luck with your project...

💬 [1] jan_kensen_nanpa_tu (2:16:22 AM)
hey everyone, I found this esp32 s3 display development board by waveshare. https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-lcd-3.16.htm 
it has everything I need for my project (screen, rtc, battery, i2c plugs, sd card slot, etc) but I am struggling to find libraries that easily support its st7701 lcd display, and I don't want to have to write my own library. Any suggestions? I really want to use this board because it literally has everything I need except that.

💬 [2] toph2814 (2:19:14 AM) [REPLY]
checked their documentation?

💬 [3] jan_kensen_nanpa_tu (2:19:27 AM)
yes I have and they use lvgl which I do not want to use

💬 [4] jan_kensen_nanpa_tu (2:19:46 AM)
bc i wanted a simple drawing library like tft_espi and not a full gui

You abandoned your ili9488? Just curious what happened with it 😄

💬 [6] toph2814 (2:23:14 AM)
then you'll just have to figure out how to interface the `TFT_eSPI` library *(assuming  it even supports the onboard ST7701 display driver)*

it does not.

💬 [11] jan_kensen_nanpa_tu (2:24:37 AM)
well if LVGL can just draw to the screen then I guess i'll just use that

If it's bricked, you may have to program it or restore the bootloader using ICSP.
Have you tried rapidly pressing the reset button twice when "Uploading..." appears in the output?

🎯 [2] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (2:52:54 PM)
You would need a hardware programmer. An Arduino board can be used with the Arduino ISP firmware.

💬 [3] tuulikauri (2:55:01 PM) [REPLY]
Its a sketch you can load onto an Arduino, from the Examples. So if you have a working Arduino... or got one.. 🤷‍♀️

The comments in the code tell you how to hook it up, or theres other docs that are recommended on how to hook it up.

It IS fairly advanced / risky - if you do it wrong, you can permanently brick your device.

Aha, dang ><
I found that in the examples! I'm reading it and trying to understand what all is happening, it'll probably take a while for my brain to process it. While that happens I'll keep trying things on the windows IDE. Thank you!

💬 [2] pawlitics (3:05:01 PM)
It's giving me
```avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "\\. \COM4": The system cannot find the file specified.

Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 1```
Probably because it disconnects right as the upload starts. I have perseverance! I'll keep trying and worse comes to worst, order another beginner kit.

💬 [3] tuulikauri (3:08:18 PM) [REPLY]
Is your serial monitor open? Or the web IDE? Something else using that port?

💬 [4] pawlitics (3:09:40 PM)
As far as I know, only the IDE software is open on windows. I reset twice and did a full turn-laptop-off-and-on-again. There's an SD card and an external hard drive in other ports, they didn't seem to affect the first one that originally worked.

💬 [5] pawlitics (3:10:16 PM)
(I'm looking up what a serial monitor is)

💬 [6] pawlitics (3:11:30 PM)
(As far as I know, it's integrated in the IDE software and there's no external serial monitor)

💬 [7] pawlitics (3:13:45 PM)
When it disconnects and fails, the TX and RX lights blink rapidly forever. When it uploads forever, the TX light is on and the RX light doesn't blink or turn on whatsoever.

💬 [8] pawlitics (3:17:11 PM)
Theres another LED that blinks! That's the only other thing happening. Anything I do, it just blinks.

It also blinks when the arduino is plugged in and not turned on

That's good to know though, thank you!

💬 [11] pawlitics (3:22:02 PM)
I don't think I can run that bootloader in the examples because lilypad USBs don't have 7 or 8 pins 🤔

💬 [12] pawlitics (3:22:23 PM)
Ah! Let me try double pressing the button again then.

💬 [13] pawlitics (3:24:29 PM)
[Squinting at everything to see if there's a difference] the same com port came back after a second, otherwise there are no differences that I can tell 🤔

💬 [14] pawlitics (3:26:59 PM)
Double pressing looks like it temporarily disconnected the arduino (for like 1 second) and then reconnected it!

💬 [15] pawlitics (3:30:19 PM)
When the arduino is in the state where the upload failed and the TX and RX lights look like they're having a rave party, double pressing does nothing to the lights and they continue to rapidly flash

💬 [16] pawlitics (3:30:50 PM)
Holding the button down turns them off but they resume raving when unpressed

💬 [17] pawlitics (3:33:33 PM)
On the third board, the TX and RX lights don't even turn on at all for any reason. Maybe just bad boards ;u;

🎯 [18] tuulikauri (3:35:14 PM) [REPLY]
ArduinoISP is code you would put on a WORKING arduino to turn it into a programmer. If you dont have any working arduinos right now, dont worry about it. 🙂

💬 [19] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (3:36:34 PM) [REPLY]
Sounds like it just reset it and did not run the bootloader. Arduino says to hold down the reset button on a Leonardo, click the upload button and do not realease it until you see "Uploading...". Maybe Arduino used different bootloaders for these two and your boards have the wrong one. Or the bootloader has been corrupted, or the firmware on the board is causing a problem. Not sure.

💬 [20] pawlitics (3:38:25 PM)
Ooh! That makes a lot of sense, I was hesitating because I wasn't sure it'd upload. The only working board I have is the very first one, where the USB attachment snapped off. I don't have the skills or confidence to solder that back on.

Oooh? Maybe I'm not giving it enough time to upload (I doubt that's it but anything's worth a try!). It could be corrupted, I'll give it a few more attempts by trying different button timings!

Do you know how to add print statements to help debug? You can add them to each of the next functions. You are seeing the `Accelerometer test` statement, but the rest of the setup should print other stuff too.
```ino

  Serial.println("Accelerometer Test"); Serial.println("");
  
  /* Initialise the sensor */
  if(!accel.begin())
  {
    /* There was a problem detecting the ADXL345 ... check your connections */
    Serial.println("Ooops, no ADXL345 detected ... Check your wiring!");
    while(1);
  }

  /* Set the range to whatever is appropriate for your project */
  accel.setRange(ADXL345_RANGE_16_G);
  // accel.setRange(ADXL345_RANGE_8_G);
  // accel.setRange(ADXL345_RANGE_4_G);
  // accel.setRange(ADXL345_RANGE_2_G);

I have a suspicion... `I2C Wiring: The ADXL345 Breakout has an I2C address of 0x53.` and `Adafruit_ADXL345_Unified accel = Adafruit_ADXL345_Unified(12345);` 🤔

💬 [27] tuulikauri (10:30:08 PM) [REPLY]
Check my other messages too; but I wonder if the default addresses aren't aligned. `accel.begin()` can accept an I2C address, so it might just be a case of putting `accel.begin(0x53)`

🎯 [28] tuulikauri (10:31:33 PM)
You can also troubleshoot the I2C connection by running the generic I2C examples

hi guys, looking for a way using ESP32 to control a button switch. I have on an other module a button (physical) that can be press. I want to hookup 2 wires from each side of the button and let the esp32 manage when it connect / press the button. I need something small and silent if possible. Any suggestion ?

💬 [2] toph2814 (1:04:49 PM)
looks like a QR/Barcode scanner

💬 [3] toph2814 (1:07:33 PM)
that's a standalone device that appears as an HID keyboard when plugged in

💬 [4] toph2814 (1:09:25 PM)
👉 just plug it into your PC via a USB data cable *(it should appear in `Device Manager` as a keyboard; if not, you need to install a driver ~usually the "`CH340`" UART driver)*

💬 [5] anonengineering (1:10:48 PM) [REPLY]
does it work properly now, you just want a way to remotely trigger a scan?

💬 [6] toph2814 (1:10:50 PM)
👉 then connect to the COM port *(you can use Arduino IDE set it to the scanner's assigned COM port)*  & set it to 9600 baud... if it scans anything, you should see the barcode appear as an alphanumeric code

💬 [7] hackingnotes (1:11:03 PM) [REPLY]
exacly

💬 [8] toph2814 (1:11:03 PM)
*(on Serial Monitor)*

💬 [9] hackingnotes (1:11:41 PM) [REPLY]
Yes i made it work before, but i am interested to make it work remotly using the esp32

💬 [10] hackingnotes (1:11:48 PM)
see what i mean?

💬 [11] toph2814 (1:11:55 PM)
yes.
if you have a multimeter, you can check to see if one of the buttons' pins are connected to its ground

💬 [12] anonengineering (1:12:20 PM)
or perhaps there is a "scan now" command

💬 [13] hackingnotes (1:13:05 PM)
good suggestions guys, let me double check this and its documentation

💬 [14] hackingnotes (1:13:07 PM)
thanks

💬 [15] toph2814 (1:13:58 PM)
well it does have software & one of those buttons should mean "SCAN NOW" 😄

💬 [16] toph2814 (1:14:25 PM)
so you just need to figure out what code it sends to the scanner via serial to trigger it 😉

💬 [17] hackingnotes (1:14:56 PM)
so you mean i could connect to a serial port and someway make it trigger a scan ?

💬 [1] jasoso (2:39:07 AM)
Hey! I got a quick question. So with a 5000-10000mah and I think a tp4056. Can I use the tp4056 to power my rpi 3b with the battery connected? And can I use it while charging? Or should I just use a powerbank module?

💬 [2] toph2814 (2:59:44 AM) [REPLY]
you'll definitely need a "`boost converter`" in addition to the TP4056 lithium battery charging module to bring the voltage to a constant 5V *(which is what the RPi wants)* ...
☝️ and yes, with the TP4056 you can charge while using....
🤓 of course, you'd be better off with a powerbank module *(since it already has both the charging + cell balancing circuit & voltage regulation to provide a 5V output)* ... 
 ... ⚠️ however you need to make sure that the powerbank module can supply __at least 2A__ of power out of its USB-A port *(this should be good as long as you don't plug too many power hungry devices on your RPi's USB ports)* ... naturally 3A would be best so there's little to no chance of undervoltage warnings ⚡...

💬 [3] toph2814 (3:00:38 AM)
🤓 👉 note that if you're going the "`5v boost converter`" route, make sure it can supply 3A as well 😉

at least that's a good `XL6009` boost converter.... which to my knowledge can handle upto 4A so you're good in that department.

a switch? 
🤔 depends on what you're turning "off" ... 
👉 since you'll be running an operating system on your RPi3, you should hook up a momentary pushbutton to one of its GPIO pin that will trigger your shutdown routine *(otherwise you run the risk of currupting your Linux filesystem)*...
👉 if you also want to be able to turn off power to the RPi3 to preserve battery power, you can place it between the TP4056 & the boost converter *(you can turn off just the `+` with a SPST toggle switch or both `+` & `-` with a SPDT one)*...
⚠️ just don't place it after the boost converter .... because those circuits typically don't like it when you power it up with no load *(hence the dummy load resistor I suggested earlier)* ...

I read somewhere that there was an onboard resistor; guess it depends on the exact specific board

It will be a surface mount resistor, on the board labelled R1 or R8 or something, if its there.

yep on both boards i have infront of me have a resistor and a capacitor (both SMD)

You can visually trace to see whether they connect somewhere that makes sense as the BL or not.

💬 [19] tuulikauri (4:31:43 PM)
What are you using to power it?

3v3 pin of the Raspberry Pi Pico

💬 [21] tuulikauri (4:32:36 PM) [REPLY]

💬 [23] tuulikauri (4:33:51 PM) [REPLY]
Impressive. Thats nice. Lots of controllers those pins arent really for power, they should be used as reference voltage only.

💬 [24] ningaman151 (4:34:29 PM)
apparantly the 3v3 pin of the pico is a buck converter; usually MCU boards use a voltage regulator

Use the examples in MIDI Library to start. It's just a serial port, but with an opto-isolator and resistors in the circuit. Do you have the hardware setup to read MIDI 5 pin DIN data?

And likewise even on the same frenqucy, there are many ways of encapsulates the message. So it can only pe picked up or transmitted by devices designed for that specific type of encapsulatesion.

And then across all of that you then can add digital channels. And digital kets to encode it.
So this is a HUGE habit hole.

HID compliance is the path of least compliance since you just plug your device into a USB port & it will be recognized accordingly...

💬 [1] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:24:41 AM)
I would expect it to last about 5 minutes at that charge with the servo constantly moving.
It's not new, it's been used for a year, so maybe a less. If it only made it 10 seconds, maybe the protection circuit cut it off or the 1/4 charge indicator is not accurate. li-ion batteries have a sharp discharge curve. https://www.ufinebattery.com/images/upload/blog-typical-li-ion-discharge-voltage-curve.webp

💬 [2] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:38:40 AM) [REPLY]
Miscalculated here. 7500 mAh with a 1000 mA load, should last a few hours. If it's shutting off after 10 seconds, either the capacity / charge is not actually what it seems or the protection circuit is shutting it off due to heat, excessive current or short circuit. @grillribba

💬 [3] grillribba (8:39:57 AM) [REPLY]
oh, well i assumed that it didnt work because i plugged them both into the same power source with seperate cables

💬 [4] grillribba (8:40:04 AM)
i mean idk what i did but

💬 [5] grillribba (8:40:28 AM)
the powerbank emptied out in 10 seconds so my stupid ass decided to plug it all into the pc and it disabled one of my usb ports

💬 [6] grillribba (8:44:52 AM)
ill just try again later, my powerbank is almost fully charged

💬 [7] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (8:45:55 AM) [REPLY]
You could be causing a ground loop using more than one port like that. Or something is shorted out. There is definitely something critically wrong with the wiring. I wouldn't try it again in the current configuration.

💬 [8] grillribba (8:46:54 AM) [REPLY]
i did wire it up like i showed in the diagram the first time, this time im going to try putting it all on the same power source, not having a seperate cablr for the servo

💬 [9] tuulikauri (10:04:48 AM) [REPLY]
When you have separate power sources, you need to keep the +'ve unconnected from eachother. I see a lot of red (5V?) wires on your diagram. If you're programming the arduino and its plugged into the computer, its best to unplug the power bank so that its not powered from both the bank and USB.

💬 [10] grillribba (10:05:19 AM) [REPLY]
i didnt have them both plugged in at the same time

💬 [11] hewhowalks (10:05:25 AM)
Oh wait.

💬 [12] hewhowalks (10:06:09 AM)
Can you really just turn the voltage up and and the device will still only pull 5 amps? At least that's what I'm seeing being said online

💬 [13] grillribba (10:07:17 AM)
@Tuuli 🎹🎸🤘 this is what i did basically

💬 [14] anonengineering (10:07:19 AM)
devices will draw current based on their internal resistance and the voltage
Ohms Law

💬 [15] hewhowalks (10:08:11 AM)
Yeah, I'm a little unique, I can't really understand things unless I'm explained a fundamental level of knowledge.

💬 [16] grillribba (10:09:35 AM)
now this is how i decided i wanna do it instead

💬 [17] anonengineering (10:10:03 AM) [REPLY]
start with the LEDs, 10 mA of current will make then glow brightly.
if you have 15 you need 150mA of current and depending on the voltage you need to pick resistors that will limit the current to 10mA

💬 [18] tuulikauri (10:10:32 AM) [REPLY]
Hmm. The other thing with power banks is sometimes they are smart, and stop delivering power if it's too low... after its stopped working, is it dead? Or does it charge your phone fine still?

💬 [19] grillribba (10:10:56 AM)
it works and charges  fine so i assume it shut down

💬 [20] tuulikauri (10:11:32 AM) [REPLY]
DO not do this with a 9V battery

💬 [21] grillribba (10:11:44 AM)
i guess i ended up doing something like this if you assume these are powerbanks

💬 [22] grillribba (10:11:55 AM)
no i will not they are just a visual represnation for the powerbanks since they arent inhere

if that is Tinkercad you can use power supplies

You shouldnt have the bottom line connecting the two +'ve.

💬 [26] hewhowalks (10:13:00 AM) [REPLY]
Okay, this makes sense so far. I'm just not quite sure what would determine how many amps are in a system, and if it's possible to increase them without increasing the voltage.

💬 [27] anonengineering (10:13:52 AM)
each device draws X current, you add all the devices in the system to determine total current

💬 [28] hewhowalks (10:14:35 AM)
But does 5v have a set amount of amps?

💬 [29] anonengineering (10:15:10 AM)
no, could range from 0 amps to infinity (well, not really IRL, but in principle)

💬 [31] hewhowalks (10:16:04 AM) [REPLY]

💬 [32] grillribba (10:16:11 AM) [REPLY]
i know, but thats essnetially what i did with the powerbank, thats what im showcasing how i messed up

they are power net symbols

💬 [41] grillribba (10:24:45 AM) [REPLY]
do they mean anything in terms of my diagram

💬 [42] anonengineering (10:25:24 AM)
the up pointing arrow means positive voltage, the down pointing one means ground

💬 [44] toph2814 (10:38:18 AM) [REPLY]
no... 
🤓 take note that voltage is not a suggestion... for most components, they are made to work at that specific voltage *(think of a 110V appliance used in a country with 220V mains)* ...
👉 LEDs typically can be over driven *(using a higher voltage on them than they're rated for)*  and although it will often allow the LEDs to get brighter, their life will be shortened since they will burn out sooner than later.

💬 [45] toph2814 (10:40:24 AM)
🤓 to determine how much current your project requires, you look at each component's datasheet *(microcontroller, LEDs, sensors, motors, etc)*  to see what current they will need... add all of them together... to get the total current requirement...

💬 [46] toph2814 (10:42:09 AM)
👉 so just to clarify, the key is the amount of current each LED will pull... for standard 5mm LEDs, that's usually upto 20mA... for super bright "cob"-type LEDs, they typically range for 1W to 5W *(so 200mA to as high as 1A)* ... so 15 of them would mean you'd multiply the current requirements...
☝️ this will then dictate the amount of power your power supply needs to provide at 5V... so for 15x 1W LEDs == 3A *(or a 15W power supply with 5V output)*  minimum *(a 30W power supply will work fine, just means it has a big enough "reservoir" to handle more current than is needed)*...
😄 hope this clears things up...

💬 [52] toph2814 (10:45:19 AM)
voltage is fixed based on the component

💬 [53] hewhowalks (10:45:30 AM)
Err amps*

💬 [54] toph2814 (10:45:35 AM)
voltage will drop if your power supply can't handle the current that is needed

**closely** watch the wiring in regards to the columns and lines

💬 [59] toph2814 (10:47:27 AM) [REPLY]
also, you'll notice your resistor isn't even connected to the circuit *(it's an open circuit, so no current will flow)*

💬 [60] grillribba (10:47:32 AM) [REPLY]
so what does that thingie do between the ground anv 5v

💬 [61] .pseud0 (10:48:58 AM) [REPLY]
The thing between 5V and GND is the resistor and the LED

💬 [62] grillribba (10:49:13 AM) [REPLY]
ok so what does the resistor do

💬 [63] .pseud0 (10:49:14 AM)
or well between GND and D13, which the Arduino will apply 5V on.

💬 [64] .pseud0 (10:49:21 AM)
the resistor limits the current through the LED.

💬 [65] .pseud0 (10:49:43 AM)
Once the forward voltage of the LED is reached (light emitting diode), it will start to conduct current exponenteially fast, if not otherwise limited.

💬 [66] .pseud0 (10:50:01 AM)


💬 [67] toph2814 (10:50:03 AM)
*(by it's nature, it's like a short circuit)*

💬 [68] .pseud0 (10:50:05 AM)
That's the I-V curve of the diode.

💬 [69] grillribba (10:50:15 AM)
i accidentally plugged it in both 5v and ground yesterday and it made a crackling noise and dont work anymore

💬 [70] .pseud0 (10:50:26 AM)
yes, LED burned through, it's dead.

💬 [71] toph2814 (10:50:38 AM)
no resistance == infinite current flowing through the board...

does this require resistors

how do i know when i need that

🎯 [77] toph2814 (10:52:30 AM) [REPLY]
so internal components get fried *(typically the 5V LDO regulator if you're powering via `VIN` or the barrel plug; a USB port can also get damaged if you do this & the motherboard will typically cut power to it)*

💬 [78] .pseud0 (10:52:55 AM) [REPLY]
yeah you can't onnect 9V from the batteries dirvely to 5V, that will kill it

💬 [79] .pseud0 (10:53:13 AM)
it must go to VIN of the Arduino (and GND to GND), then the Arduino will create 5V with which you can power the sensor.

💬 [80] .pseud0 (10:53:37 AM)
or was it maybe meant to be 6 Volt instead of 9V (4xAA @ 1.5V)

💬 [81] grillribba (10:53:48 AM) [REPLY]
i forgot to mention that its just a placeholder since i couldnt find a powerbank in the component list, the 9v is a placeholder for a 5v usb powerbank

💬 [82] toph2814 (10:56:57 AM)
your servos are 3V to 6V SG90s... so it should be good at 5V

Yes, you press the upload button and then you open the serial monitor at 9600 baud

💬 [24] .pseud0 (5:49:55 PM)
```cpp

#include <Wire.h>
 
 
void setup()

  Wire.begin();
 
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial);             // Leonardo: wait for serial monitor
  Serial.println("\nI2C Scanner");
}
 
 
void loop()
{
  byte error, address;
  int nDevices;
 
  Serial.println("Scanning...");
 
  nDevices = 0;
  for(address = 1; address < 127; address++ )
  {
    // The i2c_scanner uses the return value of
    // the Write.endTransmisstion to see if
    // a device did acknowledge to the address.
    Wire.beginTransmission(address);
    error = Wire.endTransmission();
 
    if (error == 0)
    {
      Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
      if (address<16)
        Serial.print("0");

💬 [28] lickyy (5:50:54 PM)
it stays as Scanning

💬 [29] .pseud0 (5:51:10 PM)
that's not good. something is blocking the bus.

💬 [30] .pseud0 (5:51:12 PM)


💬 [31] .pseud0 (5:51:26 PM)
When you disconnect the SCL and SDA wires (top yellow and green above AREF)

💬 [32] .pseud0 (5:51:33 PM)
does it finish scanning?

💬 [33] lickyy (5:51:41 PM)
i'll check

💬 [34] lickyy (5:52:53 PM)
yes

💬 [35] lickyy (5:52:58 PM)
but it says no device found

💬 [36] .pseud0 (5:53:15 PM)
okay, so as soon as you plig in your SCL and SDA it locks up the bus

💬 [37] .pseud0 (5:53:31 PM)
are you sure your SCL connects to the Servo board's SCL and your SDA connects to the Servo board's SDA?

💬 [38] .pseud0 (5:53:38 PM)


💬 [39] .pseud0 (5:54:06 PM)
like, if you exchange SCL and SDA, does it find an I2C device or keep hanging?

💬 [40] .pseud0 (5:56:52 PM)
mhm, looks right on the servo board.

💬 [41] lickyy (5:57:16 PM)
so i exchange the yellow with the green??

💬 [42] lickyy (5:57:36 PM)
on the Arduino

💬 [43] .pseud0 (5:57:47 PM)
yeah just as a test, but it looks already right in the picture

💬 [44] .pseud0 (5:57:53 PM)
SDA to SDA and SCL to SCL

the trace between the middle pad at "VCC selelect" and the right "5V" is intact right?

not cut?

💬 [51] lickyy (6:01:25 PM)


💬 [52] .pseud0 (6:02:29 PM)
is that track cut? do both LEDs, red and Green light up?

💬 [53] .pseud0 (6:02:36 PM)


💬 [54] .pseud0 (6:03:23 PM)
because both LEDs, right and green (in the original adafruit design) should light up

💬 [55] .pseud0 (6:03:33 PM)
one is fo VCC present the other one is for 5.0V present

💬 [56] lickyy (6:03:37 PM) [REPLY]
two LEDs on the Servo Shield light up red and on the arduino there is a green light and a orange light

yes, SCL to SCL and SDA to SDA

💬 [72] .pseud0 (6:07:49 PM)
between Arduino <--> Servo board

i actually ordered one a few hours ago

💬 [89] .pseud0 (6:17:47 PM) [REPLY]
in regards to these three pads you can use your multimeter to measure:
* red lead in the middle pad, black lead on ground of the arduino (e.g. USB connector shield): gives you the supply voltage of the PCA9.. chip. should be +5V. If it's 0 then the PCA chip has no power. then the middle pad should be connected to the lower 5V pad with a blob of solder.
* red lead on the bottom pad, black lead on ground of the arduino (e.g. USB connector shield): gives you the 5V voltage on the board. should be +5V.

💬 [90] .pseud0 (6:18:15 PM)
if it has power, then check continuity between the SCL <--> SCL and SDA <--> SDA connection. (arduino <-> servo board).

🎯 [91] .pseud0 (6:18:42 PM)
if the servo board has power and the i2c lines are connected properly, it **should** be showing up on the I2c scanner..
Should also be a direct connection between the Arduino's GND pin and the servo shield's GND pin

💬 [92] .pseud0 (6:19:19 PM)
reference pictures of that board have a visible trace between the middle pad and the lower 5V pad

💬 [93] grillribba (12:30:51 PM)
Does this make sense

💬 [94] tuulikauri (12:31:53 PM) [REPLY]
PPB1 ground needs to be connected to ground

💬 [95] lickyy (12:31:57 PM) [REPLY]
I've tested the multimeter on a few spots and found that there is power coming to the servo shield but no power exiting it, there is also power going to the servo. I was messing around with a few spots incase i may have put the wires into the wrong place and accidently put the wires into two little holes and that then powered the Arduino but it was a bit twitchy with power and the servo didn't move.

why is the shield not plugged into the UNO?

💬 [106] tuulikauri (12:43:42 PM) [REPLY]

💬 [107] lickyy (12:43:53 PM) [REPLY]
the normal way of connecting them for some reason doesn't have power

also the images i showed, the battery isn't actually on 😅

💬 [109] tuulikauri (12:46:36 PM) [REPLY]
Whats the last thing you did when the power dropped out? If you're building one thing at a time, you would undo the last thing, power would come back, and then you'd examine the last thing to figure out why it's broken.

💬 [110] lickyy (12:49:28 PM) [REPLY]
the power comes into the servo shield 👌  and power also goes into where the servos are plugged in 👌  but where you would normally plug the Arduino uno cables don't have power

💬 [111] .pseud0 (12:49:52 PM) [REPLY]
and what connections are those? SCL and SDA?

💬 [112] .pseud0 (12:50:16 PM)
they should be resting at a +5V voltage level when no I2C transfer is being done. They will go to 0V during data transmissions.

💬 [113] .pseud0 (12:50:29 PM)
it's a voltage signal after all, not a power line.

💬 [114] lickyy (12:52:05 PM)
the black and red cables in the photo that arent actually in anything atm but they were in 5V and ground

💬 [115] lickyy (12:54:40 PM)
this is how it was before where there is no power

you should not need to use the holes for the optional bypass capacitor at all. your GND and +5V should plug into the upper right GND and 5V pin perfectly fine

Hey y'all.  New guy here and I'm looking for a "Noob" help section.  Currently making this project (https://www.instructables.com/90s-Payphone-Boombox-Hack/) with some modifications and nothing seems to be working.  I probably need a basic understanding of how this all works and I'm kind of a ludite, so is there a beginer help section?  I don't want to clutter up the main channels with basic stuff.

All of it.  But right now, I belive I have the arduino and the vs1053 set up right.  All the pins align and plug in fine.  I'm not using the amp.  I can run a test on the vs1053 that plays a tone, and that works, but I can't get anything off of the sd card to play.  I'm just using a set of headphones to test the audio right now and the arduino is plugged into my computer for power.

But regardless even simple code from chat to turn the motors couldn’t get them to rotate slowly or mid range

💬 [28] tuulikauri (5:35:40 PM)
tone() is a PWM signal function. If you havent fried something, and if the motors arent crap (they might be...) then they SAY that they will adjust speed with PWM. So you have to trust what they say. But amazon or Aliexpress supplies frequently lie too.

No I couldn’t ever get the speed down… depending on if I used tone or Analog it might go really slow or really fast… but I think the slow was just a frequency issue and that’s why it was slow

💬 [41] jtg1228 (5:39:51 PM)
So ur saying that if I can blink an LED then the motor is the issue?

Like I said either relalllyy  slow or reallly fast

💬 [43] jtg1228 (5:40:34 PM)
But I can tell u 100% if it was normal it might’ve been a frequency issue

No it’s more of an in the middle issue

💬 [45] jtg1228 (5:41:18 PM)
Either super slow or super fast but I can’t control it by changing the values… I was only able to because I used a different function which was probably incompatible and wasn’t feeding it properly so it turned slowly

💬 [46] jtg1228 (5:42:21 PM)
Wait but just to be clear with what @Tuuli 🎹🎸🤘, if the led blinks then that means the motor has an issue?

UNOs use 5V, maybe the controller is fried if you connected 5V to a 3.3V logic pin. Not sure. Did they come with any more information?

💬 [67] jtg1228 (5:51:09 PM)
Tuuli u saw my diagram?

💬 [68] jtg1228 (5:51:51 PM)
Ok can we keep this educational please 🤣

💬 [69] jtg1228 (5:52:23 PM)
I’ve asked like 6 times if it’s ok that I’m connecting the PWM straight into the arduino without any regulation

💬 [70] jtg1228 (5:52:32 PM)
Can u say yes or no

💬 [71] jtg1228 (5:52:51 PM)
I’m not being rude when I say that I’m just trying to be direct so I don’t lose you

💬 [72] jtg1228 (5:53:02 PM)
Why can’t you tell me

💬 [73] jtg1228 (5:53:04 PM)
Hahaha

💬 [74] jtg1228 (5:53:42 PM)
Wdym damage has already been done?

💬 [75] jtg1228 (5:53:52 PM)
Can u just tell me a yes or no to that question please?

💬 [76] jtg1228 (5:54:59 PM)
Why am I over driving them?

💬 [77] jtg1228 (5:55:08 PM)
Which part of the connection is causing me to do that

💬 [78] jtg1228 (5:55:22 PM)
The PWM Power or smtg else?

💬 [79] jtg1228 (5:55:48 PM)
Ok so I do need a resistor?

💬 [80] jtg1228 (5:56:11 PM)
Andddddd… Houdini

💬 [81] jtg1228 (5:57:42 PM)
You do know there’s a motor driver in the motor right?

💬 [82] jtg1228 (5:59:11 PM)
Ur saying my PWM is sending 5V signals to a 3V

💬 [83] jtg1228 (6:00:03 PM)
But what I don’t get is how am I supposed to know that if my motors didn’t say anything?

💬 [84] jtg1228 (6:00:11 PM)
How can I know if they’re 5 or 3.3

💬 [85] tuulikauri (6:01:05 PM)
Is this your part #? Look for an actual datasheet for this.

💬 [86] jtg1228 (6:01:23 PM)
Yes

💬 [87] jtg1228 (6:01:28 PM)
I tried not much good info

💬 [88] tuulikauri (6:01:51 PM)


💬 [89] tuulikauri (6:02:02 PM)
(without the random red dots lol)

💬 [90] jtg1228 (6:03:06 PM)
So where did u see the motor takes 3.3V for PWM input

💬 [91] jtg1228 (6:03:09 PM)
So I can find myself

💬 [92] jtg1228 (6:03:20 PM)
Thanks again for all the help up till now I appreciate it

💬 [93] tuulikauri (6:03:24 PM)


💬 [94] tuulikauri (6:03:47 PM) [REPLY]
The amazon seller information that I posted says 3.7V on it. I highlighted and underlined it.

💬 [95] jtg1228 (6:04:33 PM)
Ya but it was talking about the other 3 lines not the PWM directly

💬 [96] jtg1228 (6:04:43 PM)
lol

💬 [97] tuulikauri (6:04:46 PM)
You need to learn what you bought though. Thats the point.

💬 [98] jtg1228 (6:04:53 PM)
But mine still turn btw idk if that tells u anything

💬 [99] tuulikauri (6:05:23 PM)
If you buy things that arent documented from sites that dont document it, you need to do a bunch of research to learn how to use it. Its a tradeoff for the low prices.

💬 [100] jtg1228 (6:05:28 PM)
But ur saying if I was supplying 3.3V I may have finished my project by now cuz my PWM signals would’ve been normal

💬 [101] jtg1228 (6:06:03 PM)
I bought these off Amazon and got scammed actually I didn’t just buy for cheap

💬 [102] jtg1228 (6:06:24 PM)
Really my computer?

💬 [103] tuulikauri (6:06:40 PM) [REPLY]
Even worse. =\

💬 [104] jtg1228 (6:06:43 PM)
I paid like 20-30$

💬 [105] jtg1228 (6:07:19 PM)
So now one more thing

💬 [106] jtg1228 (6:07:37 PM)
If I buy new motors and I make sure they’re getting 3.3V I shouldn’t have issues anymore?

💬 [107] jtg1228 (6:07:44 PM)
Controlling the speed should be fine?

💬 [108] tuulikauri (6:07:45 PM)
This MIGHT be your product. Looks like without the harness maybe. Or maybe without a driver board. https://www.nidec.com/en/product/search/category/B101/M102/S100/NCJ-24H-24-01/

💬 [109] jtg1228 (6:08:50 PM)
Yea true

💬 [110] jtg1228 (6:09:05 PM)
Ya but I can’t interpret anything from that site… I’ve come across it before

💬 [111] tuulikauri (6:09:07 PM) [REPLY]
I need to see the actual datasheet before telling you with any confidence. Without solid information we dont know... going off what some other users experienced is just a weak data point. Enough reason to be cautious and look for more official info though.

💬 [112] jtg1228 (6:09:59 PM)
Wdym by a weak data point?

💬 [113] tuulikauri (6:10:04 PM)
...

💬 [114] jtg1228 (6:10:05 PM)
Like there’s limited info?

💬 [115] jtg1228 (6:11:49 PM)
Ok I see

💬 [116] jtg1228 (6:12:37 PM)
Keep a cube upright

Yep

💬 [121] jtg1228 (6:14:37 PM)
Merci

💬 [122] jtg1228 (6:14:58 PM)
Am I going to have to take it apart and re solder everything …

💬 [123] jtg1228 (6:15:00 PM)
😭

💬 [124] jtg1228 (6:18:29 PM)
Oof

💬 [125] jtg1228 (6:19:06 PM)
So is that my only issue that we know of? If I connect the motors and make it 3.3V instead of 5V should I have a working cube that reacts properly?

💬 [126] jtg1228 (6:20:36 PM)
No I meant reacts to the code not like balmcing

💬 [127] jtg1228 (6:20:52 PM)
Like by react I mean if I speed it up it’ll speed up 🆙

💬 [128] jtg1228 (6:21:05 PM)
Will all the parts be connected properly

💬 [129] tuulikauri (6:22:12 PM) [REPLY]
Again, we dont know for SURE that its a 3.3V driver board. Well I dont. Maybe Dash did more research for you.

💬 [130] jtg1228 (6:23:49 PM)
Would u have any recommendation?

💬 [131] jtg1228 (6:24:36 PM)
Can I test what type it is with a meter?

💬 [132] jtg1228 (6:25:42 PM)
Yikes

💬 [133] jtg1228 (6:25:50 PM)
So my to do list

💬 [134] jtg1228 (6:25:57 PM)
Make led blink slowly on and off

💬 [135] jtg1228 (6:26:21 PM)
Then search the web and figure out what type of driver board it is

💬 [136] jtg1228 (6:26:28 PM)
3.3V or 5V

💬 [137] tuulikauri (6:26:30 PM)
The thing with hardware is the factories can spit out ANYTHING so if they dont tell you what it is... or the seller 3 middlemen away says this... 🤷‍♀️

💬 [138] jtg1228 (6:26:34 PM)
If it’s 3.3V rip

💬 [139] jtg1228 (6:27:28 PM)
Ur saying to make it from a 5V to 3.3V?

💬 [140] jtg1228 (6:31:05 PM)
I didn’t read it yet cuz I was multitasking while talking to u guys

💬 [141] jtg1228 (6:31:15 PM)


💬 [142] jtg1228 (6:31:34 PM)
No I will read it don’t assume about me

💬 [143] jtg1228 (6:31:53 PM)
I’m a very persistent person! Just cuz I like to jump into the deep end doesn’t mean I won’t put in the work

💬 [144] jtg1228 (6:32:18 PM)
Now that u gave me a better understanding it’ll be easier for me to understand what I read

💬 [145] jtg1228 (6:32:25 PM)
I’ll also know what to look for now

💬 [146] jtg1228 (6:32:40 PM)
Let me go review all this and I’ll come back after I’m done

💬 [147] jtg1228 (6:37:09 PM)
Ok let me re read this properly tn when I have a moment

💬 [148] jtg1228 (6:37:19 PM)
Thanks again I’ll be back with questions soon!

💬 [149] jtg1228 (6:38:30 PM)
How long should this project take me to complete?

💬 [150] jtg1228 (6:38:37 PM)

🤷 I don't see how the shield could have fried the Arduino... naturally, without seeing exactly how you connected everything... anyone's guess is as good as mine...

oh so I connected the Arduino with the 5+v from the other side the yellow wire and the grey is thr gnd, guessing the current was to strong

💬 [4] xxhumousxx (8:36:17 AM) [REPLY]
so i wasn't supposed to power it from the terminal blocks

(the post I linked describes how to do that)

💬 [4] drwhite05747_71125 (9:25:52 PM) [REPLY]
What more detail do you want or need?

💬 [5] drwhite05747_71125 (9:27:03 PM) [REPLY]
1: download the offline standalone application. 2: extract the archive. 3: run the program. 4: sits on the logo in the screen sand does nothing.

💬 [6] drwhite05747_71125 (9:27:09 PM)
Is that enough information?

💬 [7] tuulikauri (9:29:43 PM) [REPLY]
Hm. What is the application's name? Do you mean the arduino IDE?

💬 [8] tuulikauri (9:31:52 PM)
And are you on Windows?

💬 [9] drwhite05747_71125 (9:38:53 PM) [REPLY]
Yes, the IDE.

💬 [10] drwhite05747_71125 (9:39:00 PM) [REPLY]
no, linux.

💬 [11] drwhite05747_71125 (9:39:20 PM)
But OS shouldn't matter as the application should be the same no matter what

💬 [12] elykboi (9:39:58 PM) [REPLY]
Bro what lmao

💬 [13] drwhite05747_71125 (9:40:35 PM) [REPLY]
Well, if the programmers did their job correctly, the application should just be the same, just compiled for a different platform.

💬 [14] tuulikauri (9:41:36 PM) [REPLY]
Hmm. I usually install things on Linux with a package manager. Like `yum install Minecraft` 🤔 I have no tips for you, other than following generic Ubuntu (or whatever) install troubleshooting; googling your distro and installation tips; and trying with sudo.

💬 [15] drwhite05747_71125 (9:43:15 PM) [REPLY]
the old version started up just fine.  said it can't download a package, but that's expected. Just this new version it just won't get beyond this logo for me to do anything.

💬 [16] drwhite05747_71125 (9:43:26 PM)
there is something wrong with the application as far as I can tell.

💬 [17] drwhite05747_71125 (9:43:36 PM)
So I need someone that knows the application to assist.

💬 [18] tuulikauri (9:43:46 PM) [REPLY]
Is there a reason you cant use the old version, since its working? This isnt really an official support forum.

💬 [19] tuulikauri (9:44:06 PM)
You can try posting in #official-product-help but its not really attended quickly.

💬 [20] elykboi (9:44:24 PM)
I wish Linux wasn't ass so I could stop using windows :wa:

💬 [21] tuulikauri (9:44:43 PM) [REPLY]
Linux isnt ass. Go for it. You can dual-boot so you have both 😄

Linux isn't a donkey! It's better than MoneySloth WinBlows

💬 [23] elykboi (9:45:38 PM)
Til you try to install stuff or play a game

💬 [24] elykboi (9:45:46 PM)
Then Linux is ass

💬 [25] drwhite05747_71125 (9:45:47 PM) [REPLY]
I just want to get past this splash screen so that I can install the packages that it's requesting and all.  It is very fristrating to not have it working out of the box the way it should.

💬 [26] drwhite05747_71125 (9:46:38 PM) [REPLY]
Then you just don't know how to use it. I play games on Linux including Star Citizen, Escape from Tarkov, Doom, Doom 2, Enshrouded, and many more... No issues.

💬 [27] elykboi (9:47:17 PM) [REPLY]
I don't wanna have to know how to use it, I wanna press play and it plays the game

💬 [28] drwhite05747_71125 (9:47:47 PM) [REPLY]
That's all you have to do really... It's the same with Windows...

💬 [29] tuulikauri (9:48:33 PM)
https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide I guess you could build it yourself. Or follow their instructions for support and bugs.

💬 [30] drwhite05747_71125 (9:48:38 PM)
I extract this application and it doesn't do anything... No error messages, nod etails of any kind coming from it. When I play games that aren't meant for Linux, I get error messages so at least I can fix things.

💬 [31] drwhite05747_71125 (9:49:50 PM)
So what's the advantage of using the new IDE?

💬 [32] tuulikauri (9:50:30 PM)
You can find the changelog here https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/

💬 [33] drwhite05747_71125 (9:51:11 PM)
I don't care about a change log.. I want to know the actual advantages.

💬 [34] drwhite05747_71125 (9:51:22 PM)
only someone that has used both can tell me the advantages

💬 [35] elykboi (9:51:46 PM) [REPLY]
No it's not lmao. Every time I see Linux users talking about gaming they have to deal with stuff like proton and wine and terminal commands

💬 [36] tuulikauri (9:52:22 PM)
Good day to you then. Best of luck with your questions and issues.

💬 [37] drwhite05747_71125 (9:52:47 PM) [REPLY]
Well, that's how you run things for Windows only... run them under that... When you run them, they just run inside those containers... Same thing with many applications I use for coding.

💬 [38] elykboi (9:53:15 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah and I don't wanna deal with that. As I said, I wanna click play and it just plays

💬 [39] elykboi (9:53:36 PM)
Also games with online anticheat just don't work at all

💬 [40] drwhite05747_71125 (9:54:11 PM) [REPLY]
I play games with online anticheat,a nd the anticheat doesn't work but I can still play without issues

💬 [42] drwhite05747_71125 (9:54:50 PM) [REPLY]
Thanks, I guess you are new to Arduino IDE then and have only been using it for a very short period of time. You should have started with that instead of wasting my time.

💬 [43] elykboi (9:55:06 PM) [REPLY]
How are you just completely bypassing the anticheat? That sounds like major cap

💬 [44] elykboi (9:55:20 PM)
You can't just click "play anyway"

💬 [45] drwhite05747_71125 (9:55:33 PM) [REPLY]
The anti-cheat just doesn't work in 99.999% of games...

💬 [46] drwhite05747_71125 (9:56:32 PM)
I dont' have to do anything to it, even under Windows... It just says that nothing is wrong... I did have one anticheat that when I clicked the link in the game it blocked the browser from openning the game help website...

🎯 [47] elykboi (9:56:32 PM)
That's just not true. If that were the case cheaters could just get on Linux and bypass all the protections

I'm talkign on Windows...

💬 [49] elykboi (9:57:11 PM)
What game are you talking about where the anticheat just doesn't do anything

💬 [50] drwhite05747_71125 (9:57:28 PM)
EAC, Battleye... all doesn't do anything other than block my web browser from openning on some.

💬 [56] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (10:00:34 PM)
It's an Electron app.

💬 [57] drwhite05747_71125 (10:02:08 PM)
so it isn't arduino?

💬 [58] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (10:04:12 PM)
The framework used to build v 2.x of the Arduino IDE is Electron, a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

ohh, it's a web browser...

💬 [60] drwhite05747_71125 (10:06:29 PM)
I downloaded the standalone version, so why did it give me a web browser?

Hay guys how do i power my esp32 with rechargeable batteries does anyone know what hardware i need? Cus i csnt find a YouTube vid thats reliable in my opinion so does anyone know?

💬 [2] klevi_ (7:04:15 PM) [REPLY]
Well, depending on your particular ESP32, the onboard regulator might be able to convert the voltage of a single 18650 lithium ion cell to the desired 3.3V. For that the droupout voltage needs to be very low.

What regulator does your ESP32 use? Google the datasheet of it and find the dropout voltage to depermine whether it can be used so easily.

If not, there are still many other solutions.

💬 [3] klevi_ (7:07:38 PM)
Or just use a powerbank

🎯 [4] klevi_ (7:08:17 PM)
There are quite small powerbanks. They are handy as you don't risk damaging your electronics

💬 [1] ritizzzz (7:40:12 AM)
Hello, I have made a custom sensing pcb using a ina239 IC. I have been trying to establish comms with it for the past day and a half and I am not getting anywhere. The board is based on the evaluation by TI. Here is the code: 

```
#include <SPI.h>

#define CS_PIN 10

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Start SPI at the slowest clock (125 kHz), Mode 1
  SPI.begin();
  SPI.beginTransaction(SPISettings(125000, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE1));

  pinMode(CS_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(CS_PIN, HIGH); // deselect chip
  delay(100);
}

void loop() {
  uint16_t result = readRegister(0x3F);  
  Serial.print("Manufacturer ID: 0x");
  Serial.println(result, HEX);
  delay(100);
}

uint16_t readRegister(uint8_t reg) {
  uint16_t value = 0;
  uint8_t addr = (reg << 2) | 0x01; // shift left 2, add 1 for READ

  digitalWrite(CS_PIN, LOW);
  SPI.transfer(addr);               // send register address
  value = (SPI.transfer(0x00) << 8); // high byte
  value |= SPI.transfer(0x00);       // low byte
  digitalWrite(CS_PIN, HIGH);

  return value;
}
```

Am I missing something really stupid?

💬 [2] .pseud0 (7:48:39 AM) [REPLY]
So what does it read via SPI? what's your microcontroller? that's not shown in the schematic.

💬 [3] ritizzzz (7:50:09 AM)
I am using an arduino uno. It is not reading anything at the moment. Just 0x00. It should be reading 0x5449

💬 [4] ritizzzz (7:50:42 AM)
here is the pcb:

💬 [5] .pseud0 (7:51:17 AM)
The traces through the shunt resistor tiny but okay

💬 [6] .pseud0 (7:51:57 AM) [REPLY]
and what's the pin mapping between your Uno and that PCB?

💬 [7] ritizzzz (7:52:43 AM) [REPLY]
those are kelvin connections to the chpi, teh traces through the shunt are the big copper pads

💬 [8] ritizzzz (7:53:19 AM) [REPLY]
pin 10 -> CS
pin 11 -> MOSI
pin 12 -> MISO 
pin 13 -> SCLK
5v -> 5v
GND -> GND

💬 [9] .pseud0 (7:54:10 AM) [REPLY]
does the IC need VBUS to be present?

💬 [10] .pseud0 (7:54:29 AM)
Ah, no it doesn't.

💬 [11] ritizzzz (7:56:01 AM)
I feel like I have messed up somewhere in the firmware. I just can't spot where.

💬 [12] ritizzzz (7:56:30 AM)
I used the same board as a breakout for the chip and added external connections to establish communication and still got nothing.

💬 [13] .pseud0 (7:57:34 AM) [REPLY]
compared to the reference code (<https://github.com/RobTillaart/INA239/blob/a55a97254b858ff3f604ea47f265b18824b35a07/INA239.cpp#L531-L560>) you're only missing the wrapping of beginTransaction and endTransaction around every SPI transaction

💬 [14] .pseud0 (7:57:44 AM)
you only do it at the beginning.

💬 [15] .pseud0 (7:57:48 AM)
not sure if that's enoug to cause trouble though.

💬 [16] .pseud0 (7:58:11 AM)
Do you have a logic analyzer which you can connect to the MISO, MOSI, SCLK, CS (and GND) pins to get a trace of the SPI transaction?

🎯 [17] ritizzzz (7:58:16 AM)
i can give that a go and see if it fixes it but that library has not been hardware tested so idk

💬 [18] ritizzzz (7:58:55 AM) [REPLY]
did that through an oscilliscope, i will do it again and send the pics. There was no signals coming from the MISO line.

💬 [19] .pseud0 (7:59:24 AM) [REPLY]
then check if 5V is stable at the INA's supply voltage pin.

💬 [20] .pseud0 (7:59:38 AM)
if the sensor has power and ground and all SPI pins are properly connected to the IC, you should get a response

💬 [21] .pseud0 (8:00:23 AM)
Maybe the IC isn't properly soldered to the pads.

💬 [22] ritizzzz (8:00:41 AM)
yepp will give that a go

💬 [23] ritizzzz (8:00:58 AM)
just making sure, i haven't messed up the firmware have i

💬 [24] ritizzzz (8:01:24 AM) [REPLY]
the ic has been soldered by two different people on 3 different boards with same results

💬 [25] .pseud0 (8:01:24 AM) [REPLY]
that's the only discrepency I see for now, and it shouldn't be breaking. especially if you see MOSI, SCLK and CS signals being generated.

💬 [26] ritizzzz (8:01:35 AM)
connectiosn were validated using continuity check

💬 [27] ritizzzz (8:02:04 AM)
maybe its the layout but then the breakout should be working fine idk

💬 [28] ritizzzz (8:02:16 AM)
its probably something tiny and stupid somewhere

💬 [29] .pseud0 (8:02:28 AM)
Supply voltage measured directly on the chip's pin leg?

💬 [30] ritizzzz (8:02:39 AM) [REPLY]
not yet, let me give that a go now

💬 [31] ritizzzz (8:03:53 AM)
yep its powered, 4.93V

💬 [32] .pseud0 (8:04:53 AM)
>   uint16_t result = readRegister(0x3F);  
Technically 0x3F is the device ID not the manufacturer, that's at 0x3E

💬 [33] ritizzzz (8:06:12 AM)
sorry that was from earlier code, but that should still not be reading 0x00

💬 [34] .pseud0 (8:07:00 AM)
I would write with begin/end transaction as 
```cpp
#include <SPI.h>

#define CS_PIN 10

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Start SPI at the slowest clock (125 kHz), Mode 1
  SPI.begin();

  pinMode(CS_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(CS_PIN, HIGH); // deselect chip
  delay(100);
}

void loop() {
  uint16_t result = readRegister(0x3F);  
  Serial.print("Manufacturer ID: 0x");
  Serial.println(result, HEX);
  delay(100);
}

uint16_t readRegister(uint8_t reg) {
  uint16_t value = 0;
  uint8_t addr = (reg << 2) | 0x01; // shift left 2, add 1 for READ

  digitalWrite(CS_PIN, LOW);
  SPI.beginTransaction(SPISettings(125000, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE1));
  SPI.transfer(addr);               // send register address
  value = (SPI.transfer(0x00) << 8u); // high byte
  value |= SPI.transfer(0x00);       // low byte
  SPI.endTransaction();
  digitalWrite(CS_PIN, HIGH);

  return value;
}
```

💬 [35] .pseud0 (8:07:11 AM)
and ofc test the premade library too at CS = 10.

At this point the sensor could be dead. Do you have a reference board or module with a INA239?

hmmm yeah, probably should

💬 [43] ritizzzz (8:17:30 AM)
this was meant to be the reference board for a bigger design rip

💬 [44] ritizzzz (8:18:03 AM)
anyway thank you

💬 [45] .pseud0 (8:18:10 AM)
it could be as simple as excessive heat during soldering having killed that chip. or installed in the wrong orientation. or the MISO pin being lose.

💬 [46] .pseud0 (8:18:21 AM)
but I see no fault in the code or general schematic

💬 [47] ritizzzz (8:21:03 AM)
yeah any idea where i can find the recommended temps for soldering this IC

💬 [48] ritizzzz (8:22:01 AM)
the chips definitely are not insalled in the wrong orientation, there is a solid connection between the jumper and the MISO pin so maybe it was the heat

💬 [49] .pseud0 (8:26:09 AM) [REPLY]
per datasheet "MSL rating/ Peak reflow" is "Level-2-260C-1 YEAR" with the temp curve

Wait I asked ChatGPT about it and he said you could generate I2C signals with a shift register

💬 [12] damarggxantares_ (7:47:05 PM)
The chip that lets you use 16 leds with 3 wires

💬 [13] damarggxantares_ (7:47:11 PM)
And I have that

💬 [14] damarggxantares_ (7:47:20 PM)
Do you think will it work

💬 [15] damarggxantares_ (7:48:43 PM)
But it says i need 555 timer too

💬 [16] damarggxantares_ (7:49:10 PM)
I don't have the 555 chip and a capacitor

💬 [17] nikkis_blah (12:31:12 AM) [REPLY]
you could use a usb to ttl

💬 [18] nikkis_blah (12:31:42 AM) [REPLY]
also no,a shift register by itself is not a replacement for a mc

💬 [19] kiubekpl (1:42:03 PM) [REPLY]
From my understanding you could literally hand-make SPI/I2C signals with buttons, I dont think either of them require precise timing, and only have minimum timing limits.

💬 [20] damarggxantares_ (1:42:19 PM) [REPLY]
Ok

💬 [21] kiubekpl (1:42:57 PM)

Just saying it is *technically* an option

💬 [25] kiubekpl (1:45:56 PM) [REPLY]
Oh, you are talking about the button ones, I dont think SPI/I2C have any minimum clock frequency limits so I dont see why not

💬 [26] coder_do_as_impossible (1:46:49 PM) [REPLY]
No, you are wrong.

💬 [27] coder_do_as_impossible (1:47:17 PM)
Both of them have something called standard operating frequency.

💬 [28] kiubekpl (1:48:43 PM) [REPLY]
So I guess there is a minimum frequency limit, what about SPI?

💬 [29] coder_do_as_impossible (1:48:49 PM)
And SPI depends on the devices you are trying to communicate. You need to match their own standard speed.

💬 [30] coder_do_as_impossible (1:50:40 PM) [REPLY]
So don't suggest/misguide people on topics that you don't have complete knowledge about.

💬 [31] coder_do_as_impossible (1:53:15 PM) [REPLY]
Just like using 74HC595 with buttons.

LittleFS.h should be builtin to the Arduino ESP8266 core. (<https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/LittleFS/src>).

What version of the Arduino ESP8266 are you using? Look into the Arduino IDE's board manager and search for esp8266. Latest is 3.1.2.

💬 [5] .pseud0 (8:16:54 AM)
Compatibilities look fine.

💬 [18] .pseud0 (8:23:27 AM)
So I think if you select a generic ESP8266 in the official core that has 4 MB flash and 3MB allocated to Filesystem ("SPIFFS" called here), 80 MHzCPU  frequency, 40MHz Flash speed, DIO Flash mode, NodeMCU reset mode

💬 [19] .pseud0 (8:23:30 AM)
it should behave the same

💬 [20] .pseud0 (8:23:53 AM)
like ESP-12E

💬 [21] .pseud0 (8:25:01 AM)
```cpp
#ifndef Pins_Arduino_h

```
Is the `firebeetle8266` pin mapping, may be the same as a NodeMCU, let me check

💬 [22] .pseud0 (8:26:19 AM)
Mhm, sadly no 1:1 equivalences. Just make sure to use ESP8266 pin numbers and never "D0" or "D1" and you'll be fine

💬 [23] .pseud0 (8:26:29 AM)


💬 [24] .pseud0 (8:26:48 AM)
so instead of "D2" you'd write just "13" because it's physically IO13.

💬 [25] .pseud0 (8:29:26 AM)
Probably some configuration like this

🎯 [26] .pseud0 (8:29:47 AM)
keeping in mind the pins of <https://wiki.dfrobot.com/FireBeetle_ESP8266_IOT_Microcontroller_SKU__DFR0489>.

💬 [27] .pseud0 (8:30:16 AM)
Test the LED blink sketch first 
```cpp
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}
```
It should still blink IO2.

💬 [28] .pseud0 (8:39:21 AM) [REPLY]
No this is the pin mapping you should use. "D0" should be replaced by just "3", "D1" with "1", "D2" with "13", etc.

💬 [29] .pseud0 (8:40:38 AM)
Weird, because its right here: <https://github.com/Shuraxxx/-Balboa-GS523DZ-with-panel-VL801D-DeluxeSerie--MQTT/blob/ab51a456734c464f90b69e62585f561944b28e51/src/Balboa_GS_Interface.h#L78>

💬 [30] .pseud0 (8:41:35 AM)
Are you sure you're using the latest library without modifications? 

<https://github.com/Shuraxxx/-Balboa-GS523DZ-with-panel-VL801D-DeluxeSerie--MQTT/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>

💬 [31] .pseud0 (8:43:45 AM)
Compiles just fine for me.

💬 [32] .pseud0 (8:44:07 AM)
Maybe the error is coming from your sketch and not the library?

💬 [33] .pseud0 (8:45:38 AM)
Yeah you can chose whatever free pins you have on your board and use the "IO" number

💬 [34] .pseud0 (8:46:22 AM)
though I maybe wouldn't use the IO1 or IO3 on your board because that's used for the serial connection

💬 [35] .pseud0 (8:48:00 AM)
compiled fine for me with the reference sketch <https://github.com/Shuraxxx/-Balboa-GS523DZ-with-panel-VL801D-DeluxeSerie--MQTT/blob/main/Balboa_GS_MQTT/Balboa_GS_MQTT.ino>.

💬 [36] .pseud0 (8:48:15 AM)
ofc didn't change WiFi SSID or password.

💬 [37] .pseud0 (8:48:52 AM)
D1 mini Digital pins to IO pins mapping is in <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/variants/d1_mini/pins_arduino.h#L37-L47>.

💬 [38] .pseud0 (8:49:28 AM)
So, D1 D2 and D8 were 5, 4 and 15 there.

🤓 note that there are open source `QMK` & `KMK` keyboard firmware out there that have most of the work done for you... all you have to do is tell it how you wired your button matrix to the microcontroller & a few settings which can get you up & running with little actual coding @inVINCEable1

💬 [8] toph2814 (1:16:42 AM)
👉 fyi, you can also program the RP2040 via Arduino IDE if you wish... *(most people just use MicroPython/Circuit Python since they're just drag & drop... if you're already familiar with the Python language)*

💬 [9] invinceable1_ (1:17:07 AM) [REPLY]
Wow that's amazing!  Thank you for taking the time to explain it to me!  This will help speed up my project up to speed now

💬 [10] invinceable1_ (1:17:32 AM)
I didn't know they had some I can just put and mess with

💬 [11] toph2814 (1:17:39 AM)
I personally used `KMK` on my own little macropad 😉

💬 [12] invinceable1_ (1:17:56 AM) [REPLY]
Hmm interesting :thinkthiccpeachy:

💬 [13] invinceable1_ (1:18:11 AM)
What is KMK?

🎯 [14] toph2814 (1:18:47 AM)
the firmware I mentioned... has the code that handles translating keypresses to HID information for your host PC or device

💬 [15] invinceable1_ (1:18:50 AM)
Also, what do you recommend I do for HID stuff such as buttons, switches, etc

💬 [16] toph2814 (1:21:38 AM)
btw, if you're going `KMK`, there's also a tool called `POG`, a GUI that's quite helpful when configuring things so you're not dealing with modifying config files...

That's good!   I'll take a look when I can

💬 [19] invinceable1_ (1:22:39 AM) [REPLY]
Like what program?

💬 [20] toph2814 (1:22:41 AM)
🤔 I suppose it depends on what you're building.... a keyboard, a control deck, a macropad, etc...

💬 [21] invinceable1_ (1:22:48 AM)
Arduino ide?

💬 [22] invinceable1_ (1:22:58 AM) [REPLY]
Uhh

💬 [23] invinceable1_ (1:23:06 AM)
A button box type thing

💬 [24] invinceable1_ (1:23:19 AM)
For flight sim

💬 [25] toph2814 (1:23:21 AM)
that's if you're going the C/C++ route *(with `QMK`)*  or doing it from scratch ... for `POG`+`KMK`, you don't use the Arduino IDE

💬 [26] invinceable1_ (1:23:26 AM)
Or Race

💬 [27] invinceable1_ (1:24:01 AM) [REPLY]
What do I use for the Pog or kmk?

💬 [28] toph2814 (1:24:34 AM)
it's just drag & drop... the RP2040 can act like a USB drive ... & all you do is to copy your code into it to run it

💬 [29] toph2814 (1:25:01 AM)
*(debugging could get a little tricky but it should be fine if you follow the guides online)*

💬 [30] invinceable1_ (1:25:06 AM) [REPLY]
Copy and put it where?

💬 [34] aaravthagoat (7:23:36 PM)
So both codes don’t work ?

💬 [35] fireguy9143 (7:25:20 PM)
I didn’t AI it, but was going to suggest displaying something to the loop as well

🎯 [36] aaravthagoat (7:25:36 PM)
1.    Wrong constructor → you used Software SPI, should use Hardware SPI on Uno.
    2.    Text size → setTextSize(0) (invalid, must be ≥1).
    3.    Init tab → INITR_BLACKTAB might not match your display (try REDTAB if distorted).
    4.    Wiring check → make sure DC and RST aren’t swapped.

💬 [37] aaravthagoat (7:25:44 PM)

if an Admin or Mod or an helper could help we will appreciate it

💬 [39] fireguy9143 (7:27:39 PM)
Can you power the screen through a potentiometer instead of a single resistor voltage divider? Probe the screen supply with multimeter and see what it’s getting?

💬 [40] aaravthagoat (7:28:54 PM)
This code has the fixes that I said earlier, and trying the pot power with an multimeter is a good idea ( @Fireguy9143 ). Make sure the wiring is correct 👍

💬 [41] aaravthagoat (7:30:56 PM)
A problem might be that the original uno does not have a refresh thing, so it displays it once and then stops.

💬 [42] aaravthagoat (7:31:33 PM)
YEAH that is the problem! Its in the setup section not the loop section!

This happens even when i add code to the loop section.

💬 [46] 2graphite4you (7:32:17 PM)
I tried most things software wise im convinced this is either something hardware wise or the drivers straight up not working

💬 [47] fireguy9143 (7:32:27 PM)
It looks like you have 3.3 v and 5 v both going in to the screen power at different sides. I’m not as familiar with this specific screen. The pic of the back looks like both those power supplies are on a connected line in the cob

💬 [48] aaravthagoat (7:32:35 PM)

💬 [56] aaravthagoat (7:35:12 PM)
Can you send a link about where you got the screen from? sometimes they have example wiring and code etc

💬 [57] aaravthagoat (7:35:19 PM)
And usually drivers too

💬 [58] aaravthagoat (7:36:35 PM)
Also, make sure the wires are on the correct spot. The code might be correct, there is just a tiny little wrong error. (This has happened to me countless times)

💬 [59] 2graphite4you (7:37:07 PM) [REPLY]
Confirmed

💬 [60] aaravthagoat (7:37:54 PM)
The rails in the breadboard might be loose. So maybe screw the breadboard and directly wire to the lcd (this has also happened to me countless times)

💬 [2] aaravthagoat (7:44:47 PM)
•    Use hardware SPI on Uno.
    •    Keep RST pin HIGH after setup.
    •    Ensure VCC = 5V and backlight connected properly.
    •    Check all wires and headers; avoid loose connections.
    •    Use the correct INITR tab for your module (BLACKTAB or REDTAB).
    •    Use valid text size ≥ 1 for drawing.

Actually the arduino uno can’t run Micropython

💬 [18] aaravthagoat (7:50:35 PM)
Consider investing like 4$ USD into an ESP32, they are newer, WAYYYY faster ( uno is 16mhz the esp 32 is upto 320mhz), and it has slightly more updated librarys, and it has better spi comms etc. (SPI comms are prob your problem) it can also run Micropython an an butt ton more

💬 [19] fireguy9143 (7:52:20 PM)
FWIW, I ran your code exactly like you have it setup on the WOKWI site.  The code worked in virtual.  

The fact that you are getting the setup screen when you reset makes me suspect something is breaking in the loop afterward.  Definitely check voltages while it's running for 3.3 and 5V

I recommend checking if the solder is good. If you have the budget, maybe buy an esp32, and check if you can find the driver in the webpage where you bought the lcd from

💬 [42] fireguy9143 (8:10:18 PM) [REPLY]
It means that it ran on the simulator.  The SPI.h is for Portenta H7.  When I lookup the SPI.h equivalent for Nano it says it shouldn't work.

no I don't have one and there has been no problems with running stuff thru ide so i haven't bothered still

💬 [7] .pseud0 (1:13:15 PM)
E.g. with the dedicated RaspberryPi Debug Probe

💬 [8] .pseud0 (1:13:26 PM)
The probe is on the left and the to-be-debugged target on the right.

got it...is a debugger really imp, if yes then i will get one :)

💬 [10] bisacdup (1:14:15 PM)
reallly new to arduino 😅

💬 [11] .pseud0 (1:14:52 PM)
If you intend to do things professionally, then a debugger is definitely a right investment.

🎯 [12] .pseud0 (1:15:21 PM)
The DebugProbe acts like a CMSIS-DAP (debug access protocol), so it's not only good for RP2040, but also RP2350 and lots of other ARM based chips like STM32, nRF52, ...

💬 [13] bisacdup (1:15:53 PM)
got it, will try n get one soon then...thank you so much !

💬 [14] .pseud0 (1:17:13 PM)
Just note that the RP2040 connect board is not very debug friendly. It does not have a connect to plug the debug probe out of the box. You're expected to solder on the needed pins on the bottom side of the board.

💬 [15] .pseud0 (1:17:16 PM)


💬 [16] .pseud0 (1:18:03 PM)
Boards like a Pico 2W directly have  connector for the debugProbe (<https://www.adafruit.com/product/6315>)

💬 [17] .pseud0 (1:18:35 PM)
As do most Adafruit boards like <https://www.adafruit.com/product/6003>.

It is a common cathode display or common anode?

how should I wire the display then?

🎯 [28] anonengineering (11:17:42 AM)
to test your hardware you don't even need an Uno
each resistor has one end on the 7 seg, the other end goes to a pin
if COM goes to ground you can connect a jumper from 5v to the end on each resistor that goes to a pin (disconnect from Uno first)
then you'll know which resistor is which segment (A - G and the decimal point)

💬 [52] toph2814 (11:32:18 AM)
yeah, definitely confirm your display to verify that it's actually common cathode...

💬 [53] toph2814 (11:33:37 AM)
🤓 simply connect the "common" pin to ground & one of the segments, say `A`, through a 220Ω limiting resistor to 5V... if it lights up, it's common cathode.

It should be under "Universal Serial Bus devices".
Is it detected by the Arduino IDE?
It is probably not in download mode.
The fact that a COM port exists means the firmware is likely already installed and working.

🎯 [2] m4this50 (11:22:11 AM) [REPLY]
And it is detected as an Esp32 family device by the IDE

💬 [3] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (11:25:35 AM) [REPLY]
Ok, this is correct for download mode.
You should be able to upload firmware to the ESP32-S3 now.
If espflash doesn't work, try esptool (https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/uno-r4-wifi/esp32-upload).

Well I'd try to uninstall the drivers (via the device manager), download the Arduino IDE locally (<https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/>), install the Uno R4 WiFi board in there and upload the Blink sketch to check if it the hardware is working alright.

💬 [5] .pseud0 (1:31:34 PM)
The latest core should be 1.5.1.

💬 [6] .pseud0 (1:31:42 PM)
Installing the core will also trigger the install of the right drivers.

💬 [7] .pseud0 (1:32:02 PM)
Plus, you should be able to get the Uno R4 WiFi into a "bootloader" mode by quickly double pressing the RESET button on it.

💬 [3] kristian.k2002 (10:19:30 AM) [REPLY]
Yes, i have tried different ones but nothing seems to work. Have tried the drivers linked on this page as well. https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.28

💬 [4] kristian.k2002 (10:21:33 AM) [REPLY]
I have also tried this one https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch34xser_macos?utm_source=chatgpt.com

dunno

💬 [4] neelpuntambekar (1:51:22 PM)
like how good are they at obj detection

💬 [5] .pseud0 (1:52:34 PM) [REPLY]
this looks good. is the LED the right way around?

💬 [6] thecorruptedrank (1:52:53 PM)
yes

💬 [7] thecorruptedrank (1:53:00 PM)
the longer side is in the resistor side

Is your LED shorted? The pink lines are how the breadboard is connected.

💬 [27] .pseud0 (1:57:52 PM)
No we're definitely helping him here

💬 [28] .pseud0 (1:58:09 PM) [REPLY]
that may just look like the long leg of the resistor and perspective

💬 [29] neelpuntambekar (1:58:26 PM) [REPLY]
you can check with a multimeter does the current come to the breadboard pins

💬 [30] thecorruptedrank (1:58:28 PM) [REPLY]
right

💬 [31] thecorruptedrank (1:58:34 PM)


💬 [32] .pseud0 (1:58:49 PM)
That resistor value is waaaay to high to be able to light up the LED

💬 [33] .pseud0 (1:58:54 PM)
it should be like 220 or 330 ohm.

💬 [34] thecorruptedrank (1:59:05 PM) [REPLY]
Gotcha, let me check

💬 [35] thecorruptedrank (1:59:33 PM) [REPLY]
I dont want to start an argument. I agree it is my fault for asking for help in general, however please dont use the word demanded as i clearly did not demand

everytime I read some pleads for help I always remember this

💬 [39] thecorruptedrank (2:01:25 PM)

i got the 330 ohm resistor let me connect

💬 [41] haggerdy0749 (2:01:58 PM) [REPLY]
Trying to figure out if I even have a use for my arduino in my project or if I can just use an esp32. I am following this to try and make an ir lap timer for karting with a transmitter and reciever https://teambarnato.blogspot.com/2016/02/ir-laptimer-using-arduino.html?m=1

💬 [42] .pseud0 (2:02:39 PM)
And why does this need a camera with AI object detection instead of just like a laser beam that's broken when a car drives through?

💬 [43] haggerdy0749 (2:04:20 PM)
I dont think it needs ai object detection

💬 [44] thecorruptedrank (2:04:35 PM)

what about it

💬 [57] .pseud0 (2:06:23 PM)
Did you upload this sketch again?

💬 [58] thecorruptedrank (2:06:30 PM)
Yes

💬 [59] thecorruptedrank (2:06:32 PM)
wait uh

💬 [60] thecorruptedrank (2:06:34 PM)
no

💬 [61] thecorruptedrank (2:07:01 PM)
however the button seems to not work not

💬 [62] haggerdy0749 (2:07:16 PM)
I guess id still need to use it for the transmitter

💬 [63] thecorruptedrank (2:07:41 PM) [REPLY]
i click the button and it's still not working

💬 [64] .pseud0 (2:08:15 PM) [REPLY]
Try focusing on just the LED. 
```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```
does this make the LED blink periodically?

💬 [65] thecorruptedrank (2:08:41 PM)
yes

💬 [66] thecorruptedrank (2:08:45 PM)
the issue is with the button then

💬 [67] .pseud0 (2:09:11 PM) [REPLY]
but this sketch confirmed that the number changes when you press and hold down the button yeah?

💬 [68] thecorruptedrank (2:09:24 PM) [REPLY]
this time it doesnt work

💬 [69] .pseud0 (2:09:25 PM)
What number did it show when the button is pressed vs. unpressed?

💬 [70] .pseud0 (2:09:34 PM)
Or, what number is it showing now.

💬 [71] thecorruptedrank (2:09:38 PM)
it constantly showed 0 which i assume means that something is wrong with the button

💬 [72] thecorruptedrank (2:09:40 PM)
its showing 0

💬 [73] neelpuntambekar (2:10:42 PM) [REPLY]
this is cool but these require a esp cams which is not available or are to expensive here like the  ESP32-s3

💬 [74] .pseud0 (2:11:07 PM) [REPLY]
Can you remove the resistor and wire the button up like this. GND on the upper side, to D4 on the lower side

💬 [75] .pseud0 (2:11:33 PM)
```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(4, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  int button = digitalRead(4);
  Serial.println("Button pin is: " + String(button));
  delay(500);
}
```
Then upload this sketch and see if the number changes when you push and hold down the button

💬 [76] thecorruptedrank (2:11:37 PM)
uh okay

💬 [77] thecorruptedrank (2:11:43 PM)
doesn't that break the tutorial though

💬 [78] .pseud0 (2:11:53 PM)
you're going past that right now.

💬 [79] thecorruptedrank (2:12:34 PM)
so i disconnect everything except for the button

You can create new serial ports in software.

`SoftwareSerial` is the library for that.

that way you can get another serial port or even two more out of the Uno.

That chip is the USB<->UART converter.
Without it, communication with the Serial Monitor on the PC, and uploading new programs to the arduino won't work.

But the arduino itself can still work if only that chip is broken.
You will need a second arduino or a USB-serial converter to upload new programs to the half-broken arduino or use the serial monitor with the half-broken arduino.

found a new symptom how a transistor gets bruning to the touch before the rest of the board burns

My 4-in-1 JHEMCU BLHeli-S ESC instantly overheats when powered, with the voltage regulator or transistor near the connector getting too hot to touch. There are no startup tones and no motor output.
I suspect the logic regulator or gate driver IC has shorted. I want confirmation whether this ESC is repairable or should just be replaced.

wont go below your input then + some diode drop

Well, update on my TVC401 experiments, I haven't managed to figure it out yet, bought an Arduino Uno just for a possibly more reliable board, and no dice. Finally made a post in hardware help since I have a bit more information.

and the XIAO runs some simple code no problem?

`#include "SdFat.h"` is a compatible library? I'm just throwing questions out, i've never used a XIAO

"This code has been tested and confirmed working with a QT Py ESP32-S2. Issues may arise with a QT Py RP2040."

💬 [4] anonengineering (11:39:11 AM)
but the code compiles, just prints "failed" ?

💬 [5] anonengineering (11:40:09 AM)
do you have a different XIAO (like an esp32 version) to test with?

💬 [6] anonengineering (11:42:28 AM)
i'd suggest opening a thread in #hardware-help ask if anyone has experience adding an SD card to Seeed XIAO nrf52840 sense

💬 [1] estebanlafo (7:40:46 PM)
having a issiue with connection my T8S controller to my drone setup

ESCs and motors work manually.

FC powers up and is recognized by Configurator.

Receiver bound, LED solid, but no channels detected in FC → FC cannot receive SBUS signal.

Consequently, motors do not respond to transmitter inputs, only manual commands in software. in receivers tab it dosent reconise inputs

💬 [2] estebanlafo (8:51:58 PM) [REPLY]
@DaDev  would be nice if youd help me instead-

💬 [3] tuulikauri (9:01:17 PM) [REPLY]
If you want help you really need to ask a better question. Error messages. Code and pics of the hardware.

💬 [4] estebanlafo (9:02:46 PM) [REPLY]
true, but unfortunaley im not getting error messages, im using the T8S controller with the R8EF receiver, connected it all, set it to SBUS but betafligth dosent reconise it

🎯 [5] tuulikauri (9:03:53 PM) [REPLY]
Do you have links for these acronyms? ie datasheets for the hardware devices? Is it wired a certain way, if so whats the wiring diagram?

💬 [6] tuulikauri (9:04:24 PM)
(ie, wired by you I mean)

💬 [7] estebanlafo (9:04:28 PM) [REPLY]
pug and play type, 3 connectors, this is the docs i found https://www.radiolink.com.cn/download/e7954ba107e02fd7e9c4406078ab0662-6338

💬 [8] estebanlafo (9:04:44 PM) [REPLY]
nope its a connector so you cant mess it up

💬 [9] estebanlafo (9:05:03 PM)
the controller connects with the receiver but betafligth dosent show it

💬 [10] tuulikauri (9:05:46 PM) [REPLY]
Did you follow that manual? Which page are you stuck on? Did you do this part?

💬 [11] estebanlafo (9:07:37 PM) [REPLY]
yup, im stuck on the part were you expect it to work, the controller is fine, connects to the receiver, who connects to the FC, but its a software ish issiue, betafligth itself refuses to see it

💬 [12] tuulikauri (9:08:06 PM) [REPLY]
Provide a page number and reference from the manual. Or a screenshot of the page, and which step #.

💬 [13] diamonddback (9:08:19 PM) [REPLY]

Hows that going for yeh?

💬 [14] tuulikauri (9:08:50 PM)
I dont have this gear, you need to fill in all the blanks. Just happy to take some educated guesses to help you out perhaps.

💬 [16] estebanlafo (9:11:33 PM) [REPLY]
actually really good, cost me beyond what i was expecting and my first ESC was caput, but it was 15$ so to be expected, i solderd it well and pretty clean and i finnally got my motors to (manually) run, so im very happy

💬 [17] estebanlafo (9:12:16 PM)
the only thing i can complain is the price, but that was a mistake on my part and also that i needed alot of upgrades to my setup, like a new soldering station

💬 [18] estebanlafo (9:13:27 PM) [REPLY]
yes, tho idk why maderdash who i just realized is DaDev deleted his messages

💬 [19] estebanlafo (9:13:41 PM)
the ESC issiue is fixed

💬 [20] estebanlafo (9:13:53 PM)
now its connecting to a controller

💬 [21] estebanlafo (9:14:33 PM)
matter of fact @DaDev maybe since youve made drones before youd know what im doing wrong ? could you help plz

💬 [22] tuulikauri (9:15:25 PM) [REPLY]
I thought you were talking to nis... who defs deletes. Anyways, please identify which manual page and step. "the step where it works" isnt good enough for me to help you.

💬 [23] tuulikauri (9:15:46 PM)
Im happy to help; but Im not going to spend an hour studying the manual and researching for you to try to guess.

💬 [24] tuulikauri (9:16:47 PM)
Also you said its not wired by you at all? But I see lots of exposed pins (I guess for plugging in servo motors?) so are any of those connected? What is your wiring diagram?

💬 [25] tuulikauri (9:18:52 PM)
Also Betaflight isnt mentioned in the docs youve provided so far. What is betaflight? Provide the manual and instructions for that too.

💬 [26] estebanlafo (9:19:38 PM) [REPLY]
yeah no but its hard to explain, i did the connection to the app, it works i connected to the receiver it works, but betafligth dosent reconise it, its not a step of the documentation

💬 [27] tuulikauri (9:22:15 PM)
Ok. Well spend an hour documenting what you've done, what you're using (with links so helpers dont need to guess), and what the issue is. Once you've done that, post here and someone can probably help.

💬 [28] estebanlafo (9:22:37 PM) [REPLY]
...alrigthy then

💬 [29] tuulikauri (9:23:33 PM)
If you'd prefer you can also start a thread in #hardware-help - that will keep it all in one place and you can come and go, adding info as you develop the project.

💬 [48] .pseud0 (2:18:28 PM)
Does the display still show stuff? Powercycle if needed.

💬 [49] .pseud0 (2:20:07 PM)
Check the dynamic memory consumption. Should be much lower.

💬 [50] .pseud0 (2:21:31 PM)
Exactly, only 34% instead of 76%

💬 [51] .pseud0 (2:21:56 PM)
The Adafruit one uses a full framebuffer for the display (128 x 64 / 8 bytes = 1024 bytes)

💬 [52] .pseud0 (2:22:08 PM)
But the u8g2 can do only a single page buffer of 128 byte

💬 [53] .pseud0 (2:22:24 PM)
so your sketch can have more logic and use more RAM if you use u8g2.

💬 [54] .pseud0 (2:23:00 PM)
Usually the SH1106 display has a "RESET" pin which cleanly resets the display for each run

💬 [55] .pseud0 (2:23:13 PM)
your display doesn't have that, so if it ever gets stuck in a weird state, you have to powercycle it.

Hey there! , Im trying to configue my ESP32 with a ILI9321 Display , And im using Platform IO. So the issue i found is , no matter what i tried the display is not working, like its just pitch black.. 
Im using here `TFT_eSPI` library , With the connections as i given above in the image.. 

I have uncommented the line as shown in image 2 according to my display.. my connections are correct.. 

For testing purposes im using the following code 

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <TFT_eSPI.h>
#include <SPI.h>

TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI();

void setup() {
  tft.init();
  tft.fillScreen(TFT_BLACK);
  tft.setTextColor(TFT_WHITE, TFT_BLACK);
  tft.setTextSize(2);
  tft.drawString("Hello ESP32!", 40, 100);
}

void loop() {}
```
It would be greatful , if someone could point out my mistakes

💬 [26] mysteriouscosmic (12:23:18 PM)
Alright lemme check

💬 [27] mysteriouscosmic (12:25:50 PM)
and im gettin this warning , anyways i ignored it since im not using a touch , but idk if it affects this or not... 

but the display yet not light up

💬 [28] .pseud0 (12:26:16 PM)
touch is not needed yet, don't worry about it

💬 [29] .pseud0 (12:26:33 PM)
Can you plug the USB cable out and back in again? clean powercycle.

💬 [30] mysteriouscosmic (12:27:05 PM) [REPLY]
yes tried

💬 [31] .pseud0 (12:27:56 PM) [REPLY]
can you 
* switch from using the 3V3 pin to using the 5V pin to power the LCD. (power cycle again to test.)
* disconnect the RST <-> EN connection between LCD and ESP32 (power cycle again to test.)

💬 [32] mysteriouscosmic (12:29:24 PM) [REPLY]
I have connected the VCC to `V5` of Esp , and yes.. i did power cycle again 

Nothin yet...

💬 [33] mysteriouscosmic (12:30:42 PM)
And one more question , I dont need to connect SDOK(MISO) to anything right?

💬 [34] .pseud0 (12:31:45 PM)
no, if your display doesn't have it, no need to connect.

💬 [35] .pseud0 (12:31:55 PM)
that's for the display sending data back to the ESP32.

💬 [36] mysteriouscosmic (12:32:41 PM) [REPLY]
Oh for touch stuff.. I see , I see

💬 [37] .pseud0 (12:33:12 PM)
does your display have a MISO? It can at least be useful to check if the display responds via SPI

💬 [38] .pseud0 (12:33:20 PM)
Have you tried with RST <-> EN disconnected?

💬 [39] mysteriouscosmic (12:33:28 PM) [REPLY]
Yes

💬 [40] mysteriouscosmic (12:33:44 PM) [REPLY]
It got miso apparently

💬 [41] .pseud0 (12:34:01 PM)
but then also a seperate CS for the TOUCH right?

💬 [42] .pseud0 (12:34:34 PM)
You can try to connect the RST of the display to GPIO 4 instead and use this `platformio.ini`
```ini

framework = arduino
upload_port = COM5

💬 [21] aaravthagoat (6:00:45 PM)
The filtering cap for motors usually goes on the motor contacts it’s different for steppers

💬 [22] diamonddback (6:00:51 PM) [REPLY]
no the cap should be fine.

💬 [23] diamonddback (6:02:12 PM) [REPLY]
this IS correct with DC motors, but the user is useing a stepper motor, so the cap would be placed for the stepper motor DRIVER as it would be the thing getting/creating the spikes. 

*Just a note.. *

💬 [24] patrick_2144 (6:20:50 PM) [REPLY]
the grounds are connected through the driver's pcb, so that is fine

💬 [25] patrick_2144 (6:21:20 PM)
I have had this happen to me before, try turning the current limit potentiometer on the driver to make the max current lower

💬 [26] patrick_2144 (6:22:39 PM)
you can be running the motor and turning it at the same time until it stops jittering, just make sure beforehand the way you turn it is making the current limit lower, not higher as that could hurt your motor

💬 [27] thekoy0 (7:07:17 PM) [REPLY]
Is it alright if I’m doing this and the sound starts changing like the frequency is getting higher

💬 [28] thekoy0 (7:07:38 PM)
I’ve been turning it and I disconnected it cause it got kind of high pitched was afraid it’d burn up

💬 [29] patrick_2144 (7:11:52 PM) [REPLY]
that should just be the sound from the current chopping changing frequency

💬 [30] patrick_2144 (7:12:13 PM)
when you turn it does the motor stop jittering while it is running?

Uh

💬 [32] estebanlafo (7:15:51 PM)
anyone can help my with my onshape desing ? js got my 3D printer and it whent terribly with this object

firstly, having no supports, the middle hanging part came out terribly, alot of the fillament was all baggy but after a few layers corrected itself straigth, and after a stress test (hands) it held very well so not a big problem there

however the legs are 1cmx9cmx4cm plus the little extra base filament added to ensure the object is sturdy, but when a few layers in after bridging the 2 legs together the vibrations of the machine unstuck my part from the plate, and while i ran to get tape or smt to hold it while it printed, it gave up and feel off the plate while the printer keeped running,

💬 [33] estebanlafo (7:15:56 PM)
how do i prevent these issiues

💬 [34] thekoy0 (7:15:57 PM)
Not sure if this is alright it’s pretty crazy

💬 [35] patrick_2144 (7:16:59 PM) [REPLY]

Not really

💬 [40] thekoy0 (7:21:12 PM)
It’s moving but I added a delay to my code before it swaps positions but it just keeps moving

💬 [41] patrick_2144 (7:21:43 PM)
did you turn the potentiometer while it's running (turning it so the current limit is lower)

💬 [42] demonking4912 (7:22:01 PM) [REPLY]
Is there a delay with the initial part of the program? Like a delay from turning on to the first movement

💬 [43] estebanlafo (7:22:33 PM) [REPLY]
probably since it barely touched it

💬 [44] patrick_2144 (7:22:37 PM)
at a certain point the motor should stop, which means the potintiometer is setting the current limit to it's lowest, the you can turn up from there and see if it fixes the jittering

💬 [45] estebanlafo (7:22:55 PM) [REPLY]
only did basic setup of it

💬 [46] thekoy0 (7:25:28 PM) [REPLY]
It starts going crazy immediately  once the motor starts moving again turning the current back up (turning very slowly)

💬 [47] thekoy0 (7:26:01 PM)
Strangely enough moving the driver and my ESP32 is making it change rhythms as well

you can test which are the pairs on your motor by using a multimeter to test the continuity between two pairs of pins

💬 [60] thekoy0 (7:29:31 PM)


💬 [61] patrick_2144 (7:29:48 PM)
that's probably right

💬 [62] thekoy0 (7:29:54 PM) [REPLY]
Do both pairs connect to a number or a letter

💬 [63] patrick_2144 (7:31:12 PM) [REPLY]
the pairs (A+ A- and B+ B-) should be connected to the A's and the B's on your driver, the numbers don't matter but the A's should go with A's and B's should go with B's

💬 [64] patrick_2144 (7:31:53 PM)
also what is the supply voltage you are using for the stepper motor

💬 [65] thekoy0 (7:32:05 PM)
Ok once the capacitor discharges I’ll check if I did that right but I did test with my multimeter when initially connection I remember that

💬 [66] thekoy0 (7:32:12 PM) [REPLY]
12V Lead Acid battery

💬 [67] patrick_2144 (7:33:39 PM) [REPLY]
you should be able to visually see if the wires for the A pairs are connected to the A pins on the driver and vice-versa right?

💬 [68] demonking4912 (7:34:23 PM)
@koyo what kind of motor is that?

Yeah but I don’t wanna risk short circuiting while checking or anything

💬 [72] demonking4912 (7:38:58 PM)
I worked with steppers for cnc machines, you need wires insulted from interference from the other electronics.

💬 [73] demonking4912 (7:40:05 PM)
I forgot what the wiring is called but it has a steel shell to protect it from interference, without it you will get shaking and general lack of precision with the stepper

💬 [74] demonking4912 (7:41:24 PM)
Its a must have for precision electronics and it might be causing your issue

💬 [75] demonking4912 (7:41:39 PM)
And your driver might be bad

💬 [76] demonking4912 (7:42:32 PM)
The clump of non-insulated wires is not going to help

💬 [77] demonking4912 (7:43:10 PM)
@koyo

💬 [78] demonking4912 (7:44:27 PM)
Your pretty much making a magnetic field with that clump of wires you have

💬 [79] demonking4912 (7:45:45 PM)
I think its the combination of that and the driver

💬 [80] thekoy0 (7:46:24 PM) [REPLY]
Wait so I need to separate the wires from each other

💬 [81] thekoy0 (7:46:29 PM)
Or does the problem go further than that

How hot is the driver to the touch?

💬 [83] demonking4912 (7:46:48 PM) [REPLY]
Step one

💬 [84] thekoy0 (7:46:55 PM) [REPLY]
When running it actually doesn’t heat up too bad surprisingly but it must be the heat sink

💬 [85] demonking4912 (7:47:12 PM)
Thats good, its not overheating causing that issue

💬 [86] demonking4912 (7:47:33 PM)
What is the driver that you have?

💬 [87] thekoy0 (7:50:25 PM) [REPLY]
A4988

Maybe this joint on one of the stepper motor wires isn’t good the yellow and black

💬 [89] thekoy0 (7:53:13 PM) [REPLY]
😭I matched them to the number and not the letter

💬 [90] demonking4912 (7:53:16 PM) [REPLY]
Not a driver i would use either, but it would probably be the last thing that could be causing the issue

💬 [91] thekoy0 (7:53:44 PM) [REPLY]
I picked it cause it was compact and my project didn’t need that much heavy power or so I thought anyway

💬 [92] thekoy0 (7:53:54 PM)
I think I connected the motors wires wrong though

💬 [93] demonking4912 (7:55:27 PM)
Make your wires look professional and recheck them

💬 [94] patrick_2144 (8:09:53 PM) [REPLY]
wdym? like some of the A wires are connected to B pins?

💬 [95] patrick_2144 (8:11:27 PM)
and it's likely EMI isn't an issue if your 4 stepper motor wires are away from the control wires, which it probably wouldn't be a problem in the first place

💬 [96] patrick_2144 (8:12:22 PM)
small stepper motors at that low of a voltage really shouldn't be a problem with electrical noise

💬 [97] thekoy0 (8:24:02 PM) [REPLY]
Yes

💬 [98] demonking4912 (8:24:09 PM) [REPLY]
In cnc machines, everything is insulated. Even the low voltage components

💬 [99] demonking4912 (8:24:26 PM)
There is a loss of precision from electrical noise

💬 [100] demonking4912 (8:25:09 PM)
Is it the problem, probably not

💬 [101] thekoy0 (8:25:14 PM)
I’m trying to organize the wires now but some of the damage is already done as the connections as permanent

Its fine if its connected right (wires are were there supposed to be)

💬 [104] thekoy0 (8:26:08 PM)
Thankfully the stepper motor —> driver connections I didn’t heat shrink them cause I was worried I did them wrong and I did

💬 [105] demonking4912 (8:26:08 PM)
And there atleast not coiled

🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️

💬 [109] diamonddback (8:31:26 PM)
Just so you know, my instinct was that the issue was a wiring problem on the motor side, which was where I started. However, I've dealt with you before and didn’t want to argue, so I was hoping that if you drew a wiring diagram and traced every wire, you would self-correct.

That was my hope. 😄

💬 [110] thekoy0 (8:33:13 PM)
dealt with me 😭

💬 [111] thekoy0 (8:33:23 PM)
But yeah I was working on the wiring diagram

💬 [112] demonking4912 (8:33:33 PM) [REPLY]
Smart

💬 [113] diamonddback (8:45:08 PM)
That was indeed my intention. And for your information, I understand how frustrating it can be to create the diagram at this stage. We've all been there. However, this experience should serve as a reminder to document your progress as you go.

For any project, regardless of its size, even if you're just sketching on a piece of paper with crayons and taking a picture to save in the project folder, keeping a running document is crucial. 

If you don't want to use EDA software, common tools include MS Paint, GIMP, Inkscape, Draw.io, or any PowerPoint/slide software.

Here's a suggested workflow: when starting a project, before pulling out a breadboard, create a quick draft using PowerPoint (for example). Insert an image of a breadboard, add an image of the ESP, and wire it up as you envision. Follow this draft as you work. If you discover, for instance, that pin 16 can't be used because it's input-only, first update your diagram by removing the "wire" and reconnecting it to a new pin, such as pin 34. Then replicate the changes on the actual breadboard.

By working this way, you'll always have an up-to-date wiring diagram that evolves with your project. When dealing with complex sections like motor drivers and other components, break each part into its own slide to avoid clutter. For instance, the right side of the motor driver could be on slide 12, while the left side continues on slide 13, and so on.

I also use software to maintain not only wiring diagrams but also all code revisions, ensuring everything stays organized and accessible.

If you do this any time you need help you have everything at hand, what wiring was working yesterday? here you go.. what wiring you have NOW? here you go. is it up to date? as of 5 minutes ago, yes.

💬 [114] patrick_2144 (8:47:50 PM) [REPLY]
well you will definitely want to fix that

🎯 [115] patrick_2144 (8:48:59 PM) [REPLY]
the low voltage wires and devices are the first things that should be shielded if you are having EMI issues

💬 [116] patrick_2144 (8:52:10 PM)
My CNC machine has 4 NEMA 23 stepper motors (56mm long), and those don't cause any EMI problems, so his 1 small motor probably isn't enough to make a slight or large noise problem

💬 [117] patrick_2144 (8:52:42 PM)
but it's 120V AC router does cause a lot of EMI issues for the low voltage logic devices

💬 [118] demonking4912 (8:55:29 PM) [REPLY]
Its not making the steppers shake, when i mean by shake is a little hardly noticeable vibration.

💬 [119] demonking4912 (8:55:44 PM)
And yeah the wires for the steppers dont need insulation

💬 [120] demonking4912 (8:56:10 PM)
Sometimes they dont have insulation, and if they need it the stepper will include it

💬 [121] mic4680 (9:00:29 PM) [REPLY]
Maybe they do. I had a similar problem ended up shielding all steppers to get rid of it and it would still appear under certain conditions. Found one stepper was the cause and replaced it. still does it but very rare now.

Motors work by "nudging" the coils in sequence with the right timing to create rotation. Like pumping your legs on a swing. If you don't time it right or pump the wrong way, you go nowhere on the swing.

Lovely.

💬 [206] tuulikauri (11:48:58 PM) [REPLY]
I dont understand your problem statement. What is "slapping 12V at it" mean? And what does "the rest of the circuit doesnt work" mean? If you describe problems as specific sights, sounds, smells its a lot easier to understand.

💬 [207] tuulikauri (11:49:31 PM)
Like do you have an LED you expect to see blinking, but you dont see it blinking? Etc.

💬 [208] tuulikauri (11:50:58 PM)
Talk about what you actually expect to happen, and what happens instead. Thats the info helpers need to know 😄

💬 [209] patrick_2144 (7:02:35 AM) [REPLY]
he had it right in the beginning, I was the one who told him to change it

💬 [210] patrick_2144 (7:03:26 AM) [REPLY]
yeah it's probably not from one of those two things, when you pick up all the wires an it stops seems like it could be related

💬 [211] patrick_2144 (7:05:25 AM) [REPLY]
if this is your real setup, the attiny88 board isn't powered, which is the first problem

💬 [1] patrick_2144 (2:29:43 PM)
Are the step and direction pins connected to the right places?

💬 [2] thekoy0 (2:35:42 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah I triple checked

💬 [3] thekoy0 (2:36:11 PM)
But maybe the connection is loose since when I move it the rhythm changed

💬 [4] patrick_2144 (2:40:21 PM) [REPLY]
everything is soldered though?

💬 [5] patrick_2144 (2:40:30 PM)
or are some connectors used

💬 [6] thekoy0 (2:42:45 PM) [REPLY]
I used these terminal blocks for the logic voltage and shared ground

💬 [7] thekoy0 (2:42:56 PM)
The terminal blocks have soldered wires across them

💬 [8] thekoy0 (2:43:22 PM)
Wait the continuity test is failing against this buck converter

💬 [9] thekoy0 (2:43:34 PM)


💬 [10] thekoy0 (2:43:47 PM)
The grounds are connected it’s saying but the voltage isn’t

💬 [11] thekoy0 (2:44:17 PM)
But the weird thing is that the converter looks soldered fine

💬 [12] thekoy0 (2:45:11 PM)
Unless the reds aren’t meant to ring together anyways cause the driver is still running at least

💬 [13] tuulikauri (2:46:09 PM) [REPLY]
This is a problem. Thats not a connected block I dont think. Check if the terminals are connected....

💬 [14] tuulikauri (2:46:23 PM) [REPLY]
Oh i see.

💬 [15] patrick_2144 (2:46:54 PM) [REPLY]
nothing on the buck converter should be connected together except for the gnds

💬 [16] patrick_2144 (2:47:01 PM)
or it would be shorting itself out

💬 [17] thekoy0 (2:47:17 PM)
Ok that’s good then

💬 [18] thekoy0 (2:48:40 PM) [REPLY]
Could this be the issue

💬 [19] thekoy0 (2:48:46 PM)
Reset and MS3 are shorted

💬 [20] thekoy0 (2:48:53 PM)
By a heat shrink

💬 [21] patrick_2144 (2:49:50 PM) [REPLY]
Is there any solder or something else metal shorting them on the inside of that heat shrink

💬 [22] patrick_2144 (2:49:56 PM)
If not, probably not an issue

💬 [23] thekoy0 (2:51:20 PM) [REPLY]
nope

💬 [24] tuulikauri (2:51:28 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah.. heat shrink itself is an insulator (thats one of its main purposes) but check continuity on the pin ends poking through

💬 [25] thekoy0 (2:51:50 PM)
Just checked and got nothing

💬 [26] thekoy0 (2:52:02 PM)
Also checked the continuity of my ESP32 to the step and dir pins and it was fine

💬 [27] tuulikauri (2:52:16 PM)
Its not great that its wrapping around two pins, in general you want to avoid that because it can hide problems from you. What is powering the motor again?

💬 [28] tuulikauri (2:53:26 PM)
Also how is this joined... is there a jumper you added on the backside?

💬 [29] thekoy0 (2:53:54 PM) [REPLY]
12V battery

💬 [30] thekoy0 (2:54:14 PM) [REPLY]
A wire from the terminal connector to the buck converter is soldered there

💬 [31] tuulikauri (2:54:20 PM) [REPLY]
Whats the battery voltage now? The slow motor can be the battery drained down...

💬 [32] thekoy0 (2:54:28 PM) [REPLY]
12.4V

💬 [33] tuulikauri (3:00:28 PM) [REPLY]
Hmm.. looking at mine (I have a similar green connector block..).. the wire goes above the clamp, and clamp closes by moving up and clamping the wire between two pieces of metal when you turn the screw. There are different designs but are you sure yours close on the wire properly? As long as its being clamped between metal its correct.

💬 [34] tuulikauri (3:01:37 PM)
(Also I think you know... but always turn off the power before rewiring something)

💬 [35] thekoy0 (3:02:32 PM) [REPLY]


💬 [36] thekoy0 (3:02:37 PM)
This is how I have it set up

💬 [37] thekoy0 (3:02:43 PM)
Maybe 3.3V isn’t enough for the logic supply?

💬 [38] tuulikauri (3:06:19 PM) [REPLY]
Hmm ok. My concern is just the red wire, if its supposed to be above or below the moving piece. Hard to confirm, you should be able to easily see that there's metal on both sides. We've seen people try to use these blocks by opening the clamp to "clamp" the wire between plastic and the bottom of the clamp... which isnt good 😁 

So you soldered all the pins together yeah? Note that you can hold off on sealing heatshrink until you're confident things are working.... If there's a risk of shorts, you can use electrical tape as temporary insulator.

💬 [39] tuulikauri (3:07:34 PM) [REPLY]
The logic supply level is an easy check in the docs for the arduino and the driver board.

💬 [40] tuulikauri (3:08:14 PM)
BUT if its 3.3V power voltage.. usually that means the logic level is 3.3V also, and if you have a 5V arduino you need a level shifter.

💬 [41] tuulikauri (3:08:29 PM)
If youve connected 5V logic signals to 3.3V inputs they might be fried.

💬 [42] thekoy0 (3:09:36 PM) [REPLY]
I’m using the esp32s3 and the driver logic voltage is rated 3-5V

💬 [43] thekoy0 (3:09:53 PM)
The esp also runs at 3.3V but rn it’s usb powered while I’m working on it

💬 [44] thekoy0 (3:10:15 PM) [REPLY]
ooh scam bot @PenPengu

💬 [45] penpengu (3:10:59 PM) [REPLY]
👍 thanks for reporting

💬 [46] thekoy0 (7:39:32 PM) [REPLY]
ok so it turns out this whole time my code had the dir and step pins written in wrong 🙂 but now its worse when I fix it it barely moves yeo

💬 [47] thekoy0 (7:41:37 PM)


💬 [48] thekoy0 (7:42:47 PM)
new and improved(?) code:
```
// Include the AccelStepper Library
#include <AccelStepper.h>

// Define pin connections
const int dirPin = 6;
const int stepPin = 5;
const int sleepPin = 7;
const int resetPin = 8;

// Define motor interface type
#define motorInterfaceType 1

// Creates an instance
AccelStepper myStepper(motorInterfaceType, stepPin, dirPin);

void setup() {
  // set the maximum speed, acceleration factor,
  // initial speed and the target position
  pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(resetPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(sleepPin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(resetPin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(sleepPin, HIGH);
  myStepper.setMaxSpeed(1000);
  myStepper.setAcceleration(50);
  myStepper.setSpeed(200);
  myStepper.moveTo(1000);
}

void loop() {
  // Change direction once the motor reaches target position
  if (myStepper.distanceToGo() == 0)
    delay(2000);
    myStepper.moveTo(-myStepper.currentPosition());

  // Move the motor one step
  myStepper.run();
}
```

💬 [49] demonking4912 (7:45:05 PM)
Maybe raise the speed

💬 [50] thekoy0 (7:50:38 PM) [REPLY]
Didn’t work

💬 [51] thekoy0 (7:50:53 PM)
Another important note is that the motor is getting decently hot even though it looks like it’s barely moving

💬 [52] kaito2112 (7:56:47 PM)
Is it clogged with anything? Hot glue?

💬 [53] kaito2112 (7:57:03 PM)
Is anything preventing it from spinning?

💬 [54] thekoy0 (8:02:23 PM) [REPLY]
There’s a spool attatched to the motor but it still spins manually by hand when not pwoeeed by code

💬 [55] thekoy0 (8:02:37 PM)
When it has code written to it I can’t spin it manually so at least I know it’s on

💬 [56] demonking4912 (8:05:52 PM) [REPLY]
Is it variable gear ratio?

💬 [57] demonking4912 (8:06:00 PM)
Or just one static gear ratio

💬 [58] thekoy0 (8:07:28 PM) [REPLY]
not sure but heres the motor link https://a.co/d/bytwRea

💬 [59] patrick_2144 (8:11:50 PM) [REPLY]
stepper motors will always run at the max set current even if they aren't spinning, so that shouldn't be alarming

💬 [60] patrick_2144 (8:12:23 PM)
I would try taking the delay out of your code

💬 [61] thekoy0 (8:12:24 PM) [REPLY]
so my motor is just choosing not to run

💬 [62] patrick_2144 (8:13:15 PM)
I think your delay is making it do a step every 2 seconds, so it's unnoticeable if it is moving

💬 [63] thekoy0 (8:13:27 PM)
oh ok ill try that

💬 [64] patrick_2144 (8:13:44 PM)
just take the delay(2000); out completely

💬 [65] thekoy0 (8:14:25 PM) [REPLY]
didnt work  rip

💬 [66] tuulikauri (8:14:27 PM)
Or change it to delay(200) then delay (2) and see if you notice a difference...

💬 [67] tuulikauri (8:14:40 PM)
Can you turn the motor when its on? Is it locked in place?

💬 [68] tuulikauri (8:14:52 PM)
Like (carefully...) with your hand

💬 [69] thekoy0 (8:15:02 PM)
locked in place

💬 [70] thekoy0 (8:15:05 PM)
cant turn it

💬 [71] thekoy0 (8:15:09 PM)
when its off I can though

💬 [72] tuulikauri (8:15:22 PM)
Ok. Thats good, it means the coils are energized.

💬 [73] tuulikauri (8:15:32 PM)
Compare all your pins with the driver docs again one more time.

💬 [74] tuulikauri (8:16:07 PM) [REPLY]
Also do you know what every line in this does? Like what is `motorInterfaceType 1`?

💬 [75] demonking4912 (8:16:37 PM)
Whats up with the move to?

💬 [76] thekoy0 (8:16:38 PM) [REPLY]
yes motorInfterFaceType1 sets the driver type for the a4988 its 1 since it uses just step and dir

💬 [77] thekoy0 (8:16:49 PM) [REPLY]
part of the accelStepper library

💬 [78] patrick_2144 (8:16:54 PM)
I would try connecting reset and sleep together, and not to your microcontroller

💬 [79] tuulikauri (8:16:57 PM) [REPLY]
But you have pins for sleep and reset setup.. 🤔

💬 [80] thekoy0 (8:17:26 PM) [REPLY]
yeah but they dont drive the motor those are dreiver specific pins I think

💬 [81] thekoy0 (8:17:45 PM) [REPLY]
problem is im planning to later make the motor driver be set to sleep for some time

💬 [82] thekoy0 (8:18:03 PM)
if I short reset and sleep I cant do that as itll pull reset low when sleep is low

💬 [83] tuulikauri (8:18:26 PM)
just try to make it slowly spin first... you can do the -currentPosition thing once you're sure its working.

💬 [84] demonking4912 (8:18:57 PM)
```myStepper.moveTo(-myStepper.currentPosition());``` what does this do?

💬 [85] tuulikauri (8:19:05 PM)
also note that delay(2000); literally tells your microcontroller to send NO commands for 2 seconds.

💬 [86] demonking4912 (8:19:43 PM)
theres no {}?

💬 [87] thekoy0 (8:19:50 PM) [REPLY]
ok

💬 [88] demonking4912 (8:19:52 PM)
is that a feature in c++?

💬 [89] demonking4912 (8:20:01 PM)
your lacking brackets for the if

💬 [90] demonking4912 (8:20:44 PM)
so the if isnt running those two

💬 [91] patrick_2144 (8:20:45 PM) [REPLY]
it's okay in this case

💬 [92] thekoy0 (8:20:45 PM) [REPLY]
makes it so that the motor's distance travel is the negative of its old distance so it spins backwards

💬 [93] thekoy0 (8:21:08 PM) [REPLY]
still choppily not running

💬 [94] demonking4912 (8:21:15 PM) [REPLY]
is it a feature of c++?

💬 [95] thekoy0 (8:21:27 PM)
though note that when I plug in the esp32s3 and set it to bootloader mode to input the code the motor initally runs erratically

💬 [96] demonking4912 (8:22:53 PM)
```
void loop() {
  // Change direction once the motor reaches target position
  if (myStepper.distanceToGo() == 0){
    delay(2000);
    myStepper.moveTo(-myStepper.currentPosition());
  }

  // Move the motor one step
  myStepper.run();
}
```

💬 [97] demonking4912 (8:22:58 PM)
use some brackets

💬 [98] patrick_2144 (8:22:58 PM) [REPLY]
the if statement is only controlling that one line of code, so it doesn't need brackets

💬 [99] thekoy0 (8:23:07 PM)
this is what the code looks like now:
```
// Include the AccelStepper Library
#include <AccelStepper.h>

// Define pin connections
const int dirPin = 6;
const int stepPin = 5;
const int sleepPin = 7;
const int resetPin = 8;

// Define motor interface type
#define motorInterfaceType 1

// Creates an instance
AccelStepper myStepper(motorInterfaceType, stepPin, dirPin);

void setup() {
  // set the maximum speed, acceleration factor,
  // initial speed and the target position

  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(resetPin, OUTPUT);

  // Move the motor one step
  myStepper.run();

```

💬 [100] thekoy0 (8:23:13 PM)
and does nothoing

💬 [101] patrick_2144 (8:23:13 PM) [REPLY]
and you absolutely don't want the delay here

💬 [102] thekoy0 (8:23:30 PM) [REPLY]
removed it earlier

💬 [103] demonking4912 (8:23:45 PM) [REPLY]
yeah but its intended for both of the lines because of the indent

💬 [104] patrick_2144 (8:24:29 PM) [REPLY]
he would need to use brackets if he was also using that delay, but he shouldn't be using that delay so it's fine

💬 [105] thekoy0 (8:25:01 PM)
added the brackets earlier too

💬 [106] thekoy0 (8:25:12 PM)
before scrapping that whole piece

💬 [107] tuulikauri (8:25:39 PM)
If you want it to wait you can do this instead. In general. Instead of delay() this doesnt make the whole program stop and wait.
```ino
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;
const long actionInterval= 1000; //1000 millis = 1 second

void loop(){
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= actionInterval) {
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    //do the actions you want here
  }
}//end loop
```

the wokwi shows it runs so --

💬 [150] thekoy0 (8:41:20 PM)


💬 [151] patrick_2144 (8:41:20 PM)
you could still temporarily follow the other wiring diagrams and short reset and sleep, rather than use pins from your microcontroller

💬 [152] thekoy0 (8:42:07 PM) [REPLY]
will try this

💬 [153] thekoy0 (8:44:49 PM) [REPLY]
didnt work

💬 [154] thekoy0 (8:45:06 PM)
the instant I press the reset button on the esp after writing the code to it the motor spins a bunch

💬 [155] thekoy0 (8:45:12 PM)
then goes back to what its doing rn

💬 [156] patrick_2144 (8:45:16 PM)
you shorted reset and sleep rather than connecting them to your microcontroller?

💬 [157] demonking4912 (8:45:44 PM)
Koyo your driver isnt hot at all?

💬 [158] patrick_2144 (8:45:59 PM)
or are they still connected to your microcontroller and not just shorted together

💬 [159] thekoy0 (8:46:15 PM) [REPLY]
didnt do that yet cause I permanently made the connection (bad idea ik) so id have to cut the wires for that

💬 [160] thekoy0 (8:46:21 PM) [REPLY]
no just the motor

💬 [161] thekoy0 (8:46:26 PM)
I mean the driver has a heat sink

💬 [162] thekoy0 (8:46:30 PM)
maybe its doing a good job

💬 [163] patrick_2144 (8:47:06 PM) [REPLY]
I would recommend trying that

💬 [164] demonking4912 (8:47:22 PM)
Well it shouldnt be getting hot at all, i was just asking

💬 [165] patrick_2144 (8:47:25 PM)
that's the only difference between how you have it and how it is in the wowki design, is the reset and sleep pins shorted

💬 [166] darwinwaswrong (8:48:23 PM)
on the setup you need to test
```const int dirPin = D6;
const int stepPin = D5;```

💬 [167] thekoy0 (8:48:28 PM)
the thing is wouldnt the motor not be on at all if sleep and reset werent pulled high

💬 [168] darwinwaswrong (8:48:29 PM)
Not 5 and 6

💬 [169] thekoy0 (8:49:02 PM) [REPLY]
yeah I changed the pins

💬 [170] thekoy0 (8:49:15 PM)
```


// Define pin connections

reset is floating, and sleep his high, so when you short them together it brings reset to high

Can you plug out all wires and only connect VCC, GND, SCL and SDA between the Arduino and the OLED

it plays the animation when i choose 0x3c but it still has the screen effect

Good. Then let's try the SH1106 library instead.

just installing the library should not magically fix your board

💬 [34] toph2814 (12:20:34 PM)
using the correct library helps 😉

😓 sadly many clone manufacturers don't bother putting the display driver on many of those cheap OLED displays

yeah, earlier just wanted to confirm the header pins are actually tied to the board so that's all good...
🤔 as for your Arduino IDE problem... since it's not a native Arduino product, I imagine you installed specific the board information through Arduino's Board Manager... did you use this one?

I am trying to use a arduino uno to add some buttons to my logitech g923 steeringwheel. I entered code into it using simhub but I need a way to flip the series imput into a keypress. I know I can get a Leonardo but preferably I use this Arduino.

🎯 [2] toph2814 (5:18:55 AM) [REPLY]
understand that to be plug & play with most modern operating systems *(Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, iOs)*  the USB device has to be `HID`-compliant *(`H`uman `I`nterface `D`evice ~a standard)* ...
🤓 unlike a *Leonardo (or other HID compliant microcontroller development boards like the Pro Micro, RP2040-based ones, & ESP32s)*, an *Arduino UNO*  is not... so you'll need software running on the operating system side to take the serial information from it to simulate keystrokes.

💬 [3] toph2814 (5:20:44 AM)
😓 although there are ways to force an *UNO*  into HID compliance, making a mistake during the process *(which from what I've read doesn't always work on all clones or knockoffs out there)*  will render your *UNO*  board useless... which is why I *(& many helpers in this server)*  do not recommend it.

💬 [4] toph2814 (5:21:05 AM)
*(... specially since alternative boards are a lot cheaper & much more compact)*

💬 [5] nick0470 (5:22:27 AM) [REPLY]
So I should just give up and go for a leonardo?

I just need it to control 10 buttons some LEDs and RGB matrix, I was gonna get 2 pro minis to control the matrix. Are the pro minis overkill?

💬 [8] toph2814 (6:29:12 AM)
a single `Pro Mini` has more than enough pins to control both a 10 button matrix as well as RGB LEDs *(assuming they're addressable LEDs)*

💬 [9] nick0470 (6:31:28 AM) [REPLY]
None of them are RGB and I might need to use a header per led because I want it to act like a rpm gauge.

💬 [16] nick0470 (6:33:53 AM)
2 RGB Matrix

💬 [18] nick0470 (6:34:53 AM)

💬 [19] nick0470 (6:35:02 AM)
Would help a lot.

💬 [20] toph2814 (6:35:16 AM)
bottom line is that depending on how they are wired, a single microcontroller board may be more than enough

💬 [21] nick0470 (6:35:29 AM)
Ok

💬 [22] nick0470 (6:36:13 AM)
I was thinking to dedicate a Leonardo for 10 buttons and a matrix and the pro mini for the LEDs and the other RGB matrix

💬 [23] toph2814 (6:38:01 AM)
🤷 without knowing what your matrix needs I'll have to defer to your choice....

💬 [24] nick0470 (6:38:56 AM) [REPLY]
I was going to use simhub to code them. 1 to show what flag is the track and 1 to show what gear I'm in.

on Vin, that's not true

but in the motor driver you can convert upto 12 volt into 5 volt

Other then a simple dc motor fan any other motor would immediately sap power from the arduino if I used the plug, so I imagine when using vin, it won’t kill the arduino off sapping all its power, but it won’t give you higher volatage either

Hi !
I am trying to make my Arduino Nano 33 BLE communicate with my phone via BLE.

I made this code, based on the example code from the HCSR04 library.

```
#include <HCSR04.h>
#include <HardwareBLESerial.h>

HardwareBLESerial &bleSerial = HardwareBLESerial::getInstance();

UltraSonicDistanceSensor distanceSensor(18, 19);  // Initialize sensor that uses digital pins 13 and 12.

float d = 0.0;

void setup () {
    Serial.begin(9600);  // We initialize serial connection so that we could print values from sensor.

  if (!bleSerial.beginAndSetupBLE("DetecteurArduino")) {
    while (true) {
      Serial.println("failed to initialize HardwareBLESerial!");
      delay(1000);
    }
  }

  Serial.println("Mmmh...");

  // wait for a central device to connect
  while (!bleSerial);

  Serial.println("HardwareBLESerial central device connected!");

  delay(1000);

}

void loop () {
    bleSerial.poll();

    float val = distanceSensor.measureDistanceCm();
    d = -1.0 * val;
    Serial.println(d); // debug USB

    bleSerial.print(d); // BLE
    bleSerial.write(10);        // saut de ligne

    delay(500);
}
```

Since my captor is not connected right now, distanceSensor.measureDistanceCm() always equals -1.00.
Interestingly, my code works fine if I don't use distanceSensor.measureDistanceCm(), and juste put met = 1.00, which seems absurd to me. Any idea ?

Well yes, I'm just saying in this case the arduino will not power them, so he probably needs (I think) some transistors

💬 [108] estebanlafo (5:38:02 PM) [REPLY]
I think because your sensor might be a little geeked out, your BLE code itself seems fine (you hopefully tested a BLE only script almost exactly like this before)

💬 [109] zkeewe (5:39:04 PM) [REPLY]
Oh and, the only fact that I take the measure, even without sending it, makes the BLE crash, while classic serial is fine

💬 [111] estebanlafo (5:39:12 PM)

💬 [124] zkeewe (5:42:48 PM) [REPLY]
I started to try another library for the sensor, but it did the same thing

💬 [125] estebanlafo (5:43:11 PM) [REPLY]
Idk ur code is kinda funky, your prioritizing the sensor over the BLE in your setup (aka you have it first and have an if before BLE initialise)

💬 [126] zkeewe (5:43:12 PM)
maybe I should look inside the library, but it will take forever and it's probably a too complicated issue for me to solve

💬 [127] estebanlafo (5:43:39 PM)
That itself isn’t the issue, but if you do that it’s possible you made other more critical errors of syntax

Well I'll but it in the setup part, after the ble

💬 [134] zkeewe (5:49:31 PM)
I'm trying another library for the captor rn, because I remember it was a hard time finding a library for the BLE so I won't change it

💬 [135] zkeewe (5:49:46 PM)
oh but wait I can't declare that in setup

🎯 [136] estebanlafo (5:51:57 PM) [REPLY]
Ah, well idk abt that, unfortunately I haven’t deal w those sensors but I can give you advice be 100% sure its not hardware (wire-wise) but other then that it’s strongly probable that it’s bc of your code structure, arduino reads code line by line, if you have BLE activation in an if or à braquet could also be a possibility

💬 [137] zkeewe (5:53:58 PM)
Well, on the hardware part, like I said, there's no problem, because the library just sends "-1.0" if there is a wire problem, which should also be possible to send with ble

💬 [138] zkeewe (5:54:55 PM)
Then, on the BLE activation, the only thing that change the code from "working" to "not working" is making the measure, so I can't have a better hypothesis than yours : the measure makes my arduino forget the ble connection

💬 [139] zkeewe (5:55:58 PM)
what is more strange however is that the rest of the code continues to work fine : the classic serial sends are still done properly even if the phone can't connect

💬 [140] zkeewe (6:11:28 PM) [REPLY]
Well, I found that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30002710/arduino-bluetooth-and-ultrasonic-distance-sensor-hc-sr04-printing-values-over

lol, I have something to read at least

(Update: sadly it's not the same issue)

💬 [141] zkeewe (6:15:44 PM)
I think I'll try to code the thing that measures the outcome of the sensor myself

If you have wiring between the two hardware serial ports, uploads will fail.
The same UART connections are used for communication with the computer.
If you want to retain the ability to program the MCU, you could use the SoftwareSerial library.

If you try hard enough, you can fry anything

true,so to be extra cautious what do i need to buy? a usb hub?

🎯 [4] .pseud0 (6:00:58 AM)
A good USB hub should include overcurrent and overvoltage protection, so if your Arduino goes bad, it'll at least not damage the USB port, but the Arduino can still happily fry with the maximum allowed current.

wrong COM port selected, or maybe you didn't even install the right drivers, or the circuit attached to your Nano is causing it to not respond (overcurrent, or using D0 and D1 pins, ..)

💬 [1] 671gz (6:15:03 AM)
I'm doing an array into a keymap to make a button box for simracing games since I need more pins than what the Arduino Leonardo has. I made my design in paper and made the array to map them to keys just like this:
```char keys[TOTAL_ROWS][TOTAL_COLS] = {
  {'1', '2', '3', '4', 'E'}, // Buttons 1  2  3  4, Encoder 1 Button
  {'5', '6', '7', '8', 'J'}, // Buttons 5  6  7  8, Encoder 2 Button
  {'9', '0', '-', '=', 'O'}, // Buttons 9  10 11 12, Joystick Button
  {'A', 'B', 'R', 'S', 'T'}, // Buttons 13 14 15 16, last unused
  {'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y'}, // Momentaries Up, last unused
  {'Z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}  // Momentaries Down, last unused
};```

💬 [2] 671gz (6:16:04 AM)
Now I need a way to index those to actual button presses, how would I do that? I don`t need any particular order and I think making a table to map each key to a joystick number is unnecessary.
I currently have this:
```c
void loop() {
  char customKey = customKeypad.getKey();

  if (customKey)
  {
    if (customKey == CFG_KEY_ENTER)
      Keyboard.press(KEY_RETURN);
    else if (customKey == CFG_KEY_ESCAPE)
      Keyboard.press(KEY_ESC);
    else
      Keyboard.press(customKey);
  }```

💬 [3] 671gz (6:16:58 AM)
I'm pretty sure those letters and buttons already have an index since they are here right? how to I check them with a loop to assign them to buttons?
`Keypad customKeypad = Keypad(makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, TOTAL_ROWS, TOTAL_COLS);`

are diodes required or just optional to avoid ghosting? I'm not in the mood or order and solder more stuff until I get a prototype working

yeah im just making a simple button box for a sim racing simulator, something like this

💬 [18] tuulikauri (11:08:12 AM) [REPLY]
You're diagram looks ok... you can think of the single-pole, double-throw switch as two momentary buttons that are exclusive, ie you cant press both "buttons" at once. And then wire it the same as your buttons.

💬 [19] toph2814 (11:10:15 AM)
just fyi I've given them info earlier about how to make a button matrix ► https://discord.com/channels/420594746990526466/451155251580633089/1432317538963816559

💬 [20] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (11:10:36 AM)
I've never done that before, but I guess I would add another row for the second switch position. So, for example, column 3 row 4 means switch is up, column 3 row 5 means switch is down. @Jaizu

💬 [21] tuulikauri (11:11:12 AM) [REPLY]
Yeah... they need the diodes 😄

Adafruit MPU6050 test!
Failed to find MPU6050 chip

💬 [27] toph2814 (11:14:09 AM) [REPLY]
it's an SPDT toggle switch *(rather than a momentary switch, which stays "on" when you flip it to one of the two sides ~connecting the wire tied to the middle to the pin to the one where the switch is toggled to)*

💬 [28] tuulikauri (11:14:44 AM) [REPLY]
And what is the specific board you're using? (MPU6050 is the chip, it gets mounted by supplies on lots of boards)? And photos of your wiring?

ALL THE INFO is needed to help people 😄

💬 [31] toph2814 (11:15:10 AM)
☝️ as such, you wire it as you would a pushbutton momentary switch... since it just ties the row & column GPIO pins together when switched "on"...

💬 [32] 671gz (11:15:22 AM) [REPLY]
yeah with totally revamped code when i already have my own, for a totally different board and with leds and other stuff that i dont need

💬 [33] toph2814 (11:16:12 AM)
it was a way for you to __learn__ how such a matrix is done & read... clearly you don't need my help so I'm done. 🚶‍➡️

Or, if perhaps it will show you that there are issues 😄

💬 [70] 671gz (11:40:34 AM) [REPLY]
thats the standard in simracing boxes and it seems to be fine for that amount of buttons, I never read complains about that for that scenario but for sure, once everything arrives (was supposed to be all here today but amazon delays... ^^) and i have a basic testing setup I will gladly test and report back

💬 [71] 671gz (11:40:38 AM)
and learn more if needed

💬 [72] 671gz (11:41:24 AM)
but what i read online is that ghosting appears when you press 2 or more buttons

💬 [73] 671gz (3:17:29 PM) [REPLY]
is this the correct way to place them?

💬 [74] 671gz (3:18:05 PM)
so i would place one diode per button. I assume I solder that to the button leg

Hi, I am having trouble with the HC-05 and getting it connected. I am also confused about what the blinking patterns mean due to different sources telling me different things. Additionally, are there any troubleshooting techniques, common errors, or otherwise useful tips that could help me fix this? I will send my code and diagram shortly, thanks for the help!

💬 [2] diamonddback (12:55:24 PM)
Ok so I am thinking this, and I can be wrong, toph, IIRC pin 16 is an analog port on some boards. so Im sondering if it might be mapped wrong?

Maybe we need to use direct port, and try that?

💬 [3] diamonddback (12:59:34 PM)
```ino
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  DDRB &= ~(1 << DDB2);    
  PORTB |= (1 << PORTB2);   
}

void loop() {
  bool pin16State = !(PINB & (1 << PINB2));
  if (pin16State) {
    Serial.println("8");
  } else {
    Serial.println("no button is pressed");
  }

  delay(100); // Optional debounce
}
```
Please try this code, and post a real image of your board for us to look at clear and detailed image.@t0biK_

💬 [4] diamonddback (1:00:37 PM)
ok 😄

💬 [5] diamonddback (1:01:08 PM)
yeh Im just wondering if its not mapped to the right port, it might be checking an analog pin by accadent?

💬 [6] diamonddback (1:01:51 PM)
"PORTB |= (1 << PORTB2); " that should??? Im rusty, so I can be wrong

If my code works just use my code

💬 [12] diamonddback (2:31:04 PM)
So use just my code move a jumper from another pin and put it into pin 16 with my code and test the button.

💬 [13] diamonddback (2:31:58 PM)
Don't test one button test all the buttons and remember MY CODE only reads 10 times a seccond

💬 [14] diamonddback (2:33:03 PM)
If that still fails but it still works with a wire then its hardwere.

💬 [15] t0bik_ (2:33:53 PM) [REPLY]
All other buttons work, only the button on pin 16 does not work. I have already replaced the button several times, as well as the cables, etc.

💬 [16] diamonddback (2:34:25 PM)
But when u use a jumper wire only it works

💬 [17] diamonddback (2:36:28 PM)
I can understand your frustration. So this is what I think we should do. Let's take a step back. Put all your wiring the way. It was originally put my coat on it. And test button 16 and see if it triggers anything. If it doesn't test all the buttons again, only with my code on it. And see, if any of the buttons trigger anything, let me know what you get back.

💬 [18] t0bik_ (2:39:02 PM) [REPLY]
Once again in detail. I have 8 buttons, 6 of which (buttons 1-6) are on pins 2-9 and the last two (buttons 7-8) are on pins 10 and 16. Female headers are soldered to my Arduino. I have already soldered buttons 1-6 to the male headers and connected them without any problems. Button 7 on pin 10 also works without any problems. However, as soon as I connect button 8 to pin 16, an error occurs where the output in the serial monitor changes from no button to button 8. I have already replaced the button, replaced the cables, etc.

💬 [19] t0bik_ (2:39:08 PM) [REPLY]
I will try that

💬 [28] diamonddback (2:45:28 PM)
Okay so follow my steps very clearly

💬 [29] diamonddback (2:46:00 PM)
In my code, we're going to have to merge parts of my code into your code.So if you look at my code and the void setup, there is two lines of code that look weird.It's d d r b and then the other one says port b both of those lines I need you to copy both of them and put them both into your void setup at the very last two lines

I know the tp4056 module doesn't actually have any over voltage protection so how could I also make sure it doesn't completely explode in my face when I try and charge it with a higher voltage?

💬 [60] diamonddback (3:03:28 PM)
So if you plug a charging device into the module, it'll only allow 1 AM. Maximum to pass through it, it doesn't matter how much the battery is dead. And it doesn't matter how big the load is. Only 1 AM is the maximum. It'll pass through the module.

💬 [61] diamonddback (3:03:38 PM)
Amp

💬 [62] t0bik_ (3:03:41 PM) [REPLY]
Thank you, would be you be so kind to explain the me what these 2 lines of code are doing, for absolut beginners pls

💬 [63] diamonddback (3:05:50 PM)
There is no physical "pin 16" on the hardware. To simplify coding for new users, we abstract the hardware level to a value we refer to as "16," which is then displayed on the board. This allows users to easily identify and control what they perceive as "pin 16." Occasionally, board manufacturers may omit or mislabel this abstraction, leading to control of an unintended pin. To address this, I bypassed the standard library and directly manipulated the underlying hardware to activate the intended pin, which is labeled as "16."

💬 [64] jonathan_63746 (3:06:13 PM) [REPLY]
oh alright that makes sense tbf so if I try and use it with  4 servo motor like those that pull 7.4v it wouldn't work? Because a servo of that voltage usually pulls above one amp just by itself, also what does it mean to wire a common ground to arduinos?

💬 [65] diamonddback (3:06:38 PM)
So the very first line of code, it's called registry commands. It's setting the pin to input and in the second line of code is setting the pin to pull up high. And these are called port manipulation or registry control. If you need more information on that@t0biK_

💬 [66] diamonddback (3:07:43 PM) [REPLY]
Totally correct.

💬 [67] diamonddback (3:08:23 PM) [REPLY]
I will give you a bit of caution though. Just rounding it off, I'm just doing the myth in my head. But by my best guess you'd need like a 1 Ω. Resistor in order to handle that drop down, so I don't know if that string of leds will actually work with 3.7 V of battery. I think you're actually going to need more battery voltage than that more overhead.

💬 [68] diamonddback (3:09:12 PM)
@t0biK_ did you understand all that?

💬 [69] jonathan_63746 (3:09:54 PM) [REPLY]
wait, why one ohm? isn't 1 ohm wayy to low to drop the voltage from 3.7v to 3v?

💬 [70] jonathan_63746 (3:10:09 PM)
should I just use a buck converter instead?

💬 [71] diamonddback (3:10:33 PM)
That's my point is what you're looking at is very, very low. You'd have to do the math to be sure, but just the math off the top of my head, it might even be lower than that.

💬 [72] jonathan_63746 (3:10:53 PM) [REPLY]

💬 [73] diamonddback (3:11:00 PM)
Absolutely

💬 [74] jonathan_63746 (3:11:03 PM)
I think I'm just gonna use a buck converter

💬 [75] jonathan_63746 (3:11:07 PM)
simplest way

💬 [76] diamonddback (3:11:08 PM)
But again, it would be useless in using it.It's basically a wire then

💬 [77] diamonddback (3:11:20 PM)
Well, a buck converter won't do it either

💬 [78] jonathan_63746 (3:12:08 PM) [REPLY]
wait so a buck converter can't drop the 3.7v to 3v?

💬 [79] diamonddback (3:12:11 PM)
You can use a boost converter bump it up to 8v then use a resistor to drop that down

I don't want it to blow up when I give it to a friend

💬 [86] diamonddback (3:14:43 PM)
Do you like your friend err do they like you?

it's for her birthday

💬 [88] jonathan_63746 (3:15:03 PM)
I think we are good friends yeah

💬 [89] jonathan_63746 (3:15:28 PM)
and I think she likes me and I like her too

💬 [90] diamonddback (3:16:25 PM)
Then take a good Pic and get some white markers. Take a Pic of the batterys in right and use the markers to HIGHLIGHT or better yet. Have her do it, and she will never forget.

💬 [91] diamonddback (3:16:40 PM)
The Pic for a reminder

💬 [92] diamonddback (3:18:14 PM)
For my mom. 90+yo, I take a silver sharpy or gold and have her put dots on the sides the batterys POINTY ENDS point twords.

💬 [93] jonathan_63746 (3:18:26 PM)
ok, I can do that

💬 [94] jonathan_63746 (3:18:34 PM)
what about the polarity protection tho

💬 [95] jonathan_63746 (3:18:37 PM)
how does that work

💬 [96] diamonddback (3:19:07 PM)
When they do it. (Women have great memories) they will never forget

It kinda relys on the user.

@c BTW. You nick for the server breaks da rules. It needs to be normal letters and no special charaters and things. 😉

💬 [104] jonathan_63746 (3:26:51 PM) [REPLY]
Oh yea my name sorry about that I actually forgot 💔

💬 [105] jonathan_63746 (3:26:54 PM)
let me change it

💬 [106] jonathan_63746 (3:27:17 PM)
done

💬 [107] diamonddback (3:28:30 PM)
I gotta say something,  kinda my job. 🫣 🚨

💬 [108] jonathan_63746 (3:29:27 PM) [REPLY]
yea that's alright ive been kicked out of servers for breaking rules (I didn't get any warnings)

💬 [109] diamonddback (3:30:17 PM)
All good. Your not new i dont know if I talked to you before. Do u know about our wiki?

💬 [110] jonathan_63746 (3:32:37 PM) [REPLY]
no I didn't even know Arduino had a wiki 💔

💬 [111] jonathan_63746 (3:32:42 PM)
that's interesting actually

💬 [112] jonathan_63746 (3:32:50 PM)
I haven't used wikis for years

💬 [113] jonathan_63746 (3:33:23 PM) [REPLY]

💬 [114] t0bik_ (3:44:03 PM) [REPLY]
Yes thank you very much

💬 [115] sheepskin8 (3:48:10 PM) [REPLY]
i sent my problem earlier in the channel let me reply to it so you can jump to it

💬 [116] sheepskin8 (3:49:53 PM) [REPLY]
here it is

🎯 [117] diamonddback (3:51:17 PM) [REPLY]
@Toph  j7st an update. The registry manipulation fix it. We turned in on in the setup only and its working fine now. So something must be up with the mapping of pin 16.

💬 [118] diamonddback (3:54:07 PM) [REPLY]
Have you tried a cellphone or another device .

💬 [119] t0bik_ (4:01:22 PM) [REPLY]
I just figured out that there are some drivers available for this board by the manufacturer. Could this be a reason aswell?

💬 [120] sheepskin8 (4:09:29 PM) [REPLY]
yes i have let me show you

💬 [121] sheepskin8 (4:11:22 PM)


💬 [122] sheepskin8 (4:12:49 PM)
the module is blinking every 0.4 seconds thats pairing mode right? if not i can switch to the slow blink every 2 seconds which i believe is AT mode

💬 [123] sheepskin8 (4:13:56 PM)
i switched up my code to see if it will work let me show you

💬 [124] sheepskin8 (4:14:17 PM)


💬 [125] sheepskin8 (4:14:24 PM)
still not working unfortunately

💬 [126] diamonddback (4:17:05 PM) [REPLY]
It is highly probable that the issue stems from a misconfiguration of the board, module, type, or version. Therefore, instead of exploring numerous possibilities, I "hot wired it" to verify the board's functionality, which proved successful. You may now either retain this configuration or proceed with testing various options and configurations at your convenience, assured that the board is operational. My code has successfully enabled its functionality, so you can be confident that any fine-tuned configuration will perform as expected.

💬 [127] diamonddback (4:17:47 PM) [REPLY]
This can be dumb but did you try 0000 for the pin?

💬 [128] sheepskin8 (4:18:08 PM)
i always used 1234 but lets try

💬 [129] toph2814 (10:22:37 PM) [REPLY]
appreciate the heads up *(though I've personally stopped using `Pro Micro`s in favor of RP2040s, but still good to know)*   ~which is why I wanted to see what specific board they were using 😉

💬 [130] t0bik_ (11:25:24 AM) [REPLY]
@DaDev Take another look at the code, in the fourth line. I just noticed it now. 😂 💩 I deleted the line with rxPin = 16 and now its working without your code

how to flash an esp32 without using the usb?

💬 [2] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (4:43:51 PM) [REPLY]
Over the air (OTA) using WiFi.

💬 [3] faxmachinelover (4:44:45 PM)
cool, ill look into it

💬 [4] faxmachinelover (4:44:55 PM)
do you know about a solution using wires?

🎯 [5] .pseud0 (4:45:36 PM) [REPLY]
If you can get a UART connection to the Boot UART (aka TXD0 RXD0) and a way to reset the chip ito bootloader (usually via EN and IO0), then you can flash via UART.

💬 [6] .pseud0 (4:45:48 PM)
In fact, the USB port is just a USB to UART converter. The actual flashing goes via UART.

💬 [7] faxmachinelover (4:46:11 PM)
OTA seems a bit risky imo

💬 [8] faxmachinelover (4:46:32 PM)
i dont trust myself enough to always include the OTA example in the new code im flashing

💬 [9] .pseud0 (4:46:43 PM)
There are fallbacks in place if a new OTAA update fails to boot and a factory partition with a known good firmware.

💬 [10] faxmachinelover (4:46:50 PM) [REPLY]
no need for buttons?

💬 [11] .pseud0 (4:47:20 PM) [REPLY]

tried different arduino versions and all come up with the i2c bus failing

So I search for any debugging program who comes from the software used ?

🎯 [2] m_a_v_e_r_i_c_k (5:52:57 PM) [REPLY]
Do yo have a link to the Arduino code?
That is where you would enable debugging to see what is going on.
