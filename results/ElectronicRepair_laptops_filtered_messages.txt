Hey guys! A quick question if anyone knows…

Can a corrupt BIOS prevent USB C PD negotiation?

Stuck on 5V and can’t find issue anywhere.

5V gets through to the two mosfets, drops to 4.6V gets the main power rail.

No short on main power rail and even measure 16 volts present around the battery charging circuit, so buck and boost seem okay.

Only one if the two USB C port works with my USB meter. Swapped out the 2 x INTEL c

[23] Similarity: 0.586 | sephir0th1984 | 1/17/2025
Yes, in some rare cases corrupted firmware can result in not negotiating 20V, however it seems the importance observation that one port is not working was not taken into account for some reason. This clearly points to a hardware fault. The Intel ICs have nothing to do with PD. They are Thunderbolt controller. Thunderbolt and power delivery are different things controlled by different ICs

Looks like everybody is asleep. You are wrong about this circuit. The IC is a combined buck/boost IC with charging function. The 12.6V comes from the battery or from the AC adapter. The 12.6V is created by this IC by its buck converter to lower the 19V input voltage in 12.6V. The 4 mosfets are placed in a bridge configuration and by switching the mosfets the output voltage can be changed. There are two current resistors, one for monitoring the input voltage and and a current resistor to monitor

You can *read* any of them without harm, assuming you don't blow them up with overvoltage. Then compare to the files you have to determine which you want to update. You should take a backup of the contents of a chip before you flash it so you can always return to a known state; little risk involved there.

u at least 3 month warranty. They will push on this ONLY if they have used a fake part or trying to scam you.
- Run CPU Z, and Cinebench to test your CPU. Run GPU Z, Cinebench, and Furmark 2 to test your dedicated GPU. This ensures they haven't damaged your other parts.
- Take pictures. Take tons of pictures as proof. Document everything. It's hard to lie when you have written the truth before.
- Do NOT give the repair or any sensitive tasks to 3rd party shops unless you know them personally and

On a modern Intel platform:
1. EC reads the power button going low
2. EC verifies that all power good signals are present
3. EC turns on +1.8 V core logic for the PCH
4. EC waits for the PCH to tell it that its power wells are stable
5. EC asserts `RSMRST` (resume reset) to the PCH
6. PCH replies with `PLTRST` (platform reset, final high-level signal) and takes it from there, reading the main BIOS ROM and starting the CPU

I don't have a whole lot of experience yet with troubleshooting power sequencing at that level, but as far as I know most laptops should just need power good signals from the ALW rails, then they bring up the system S0 rails, and then PCH and DRAM. Then the PCH and EC does some final handshaking before spinning up the CPU and loading the firmware. Between

There is small chance that it will unlock by itself if you put it into laptop and charge it with lab power supply directly. Sorin has done it few times. But its quite rare. If it's locked also if you can open it up and let's say cells unbalaced. If you balance cells might unlock. Of course if fuse blown have to repair fuse as well. Worth a shot without NLBA if ur desperate. Also by measuring cells directly you get an idea what the cells are doing.

I read that the password cant be patched out like in the older series and the EC needs to be programmed.

The power supply goes to block and clicks as short circuit
Found overheating MOSFET as per picture, took it off, and now power supply does not goes to block itself.
however the pins 123 shows 5 Ohms and when apply 0.6V on the pins 123, all the VRAM CHIPS are getting heat spots.

question:
I have a gaming laptop with a burnt power mosfet right near the charging port, I'm knew to electronics and would like to know what the most likely problem that caused the MOSFET to blow up and what is the solution to repairing this laptop
======================================================================

[301] Similarity: 0.556 | codeconnoisseur | 6/28/2025
Yeah, this is usually a sign of a PD controller fault. Though, I'm not sure how that could have happened from messing with the BIOS chip. I'd want a general board overview (voltage and resistance on all inductors) and specifically on the PD controller input voltage(s) as additional proof.

trying to find the link from a forum where someone was asserting there's a new security mechanism on recent (intel 11th gen and later) business machines that links BIOS/EC content to the TPM. I'll share if I find it again but it's probably easier to just get the missing components and try (the soldered BIOS EEPROM in the photo is the one I programmed using an image from another machine).
======================================================================

[303] Similarity: 0.553 | paruccone | 6/29/2025
yes and that is true for all systems with TPM and I already know. But Lenovo in the last decades has been trying, at least on its Thinkpad line, to secure more and more the BIOS' security through its ThinkShield chip

The problem is that not only it restarts the laptop but often corrupts the bios (somehow??). In fact it does a "bios repair flashback" when it restarts.

Hey Mac, I missed your message. No, bypassing those mosfets will not cause a shut down during use. Your issue is somewhere else. I would check resistances on coils but it seems like you have some sort of a cpu drmos issue possibly, maybe some mosfet is failing and is crashing under any load. The bios can get corrupted if battery locks/is too low.

The theory on modern platform is as follows. Main Power Rail up, EC up, Chipset up but just for a moment to sent it back to sleep (DeepSleep). If the Chipset can not send itself into deep sleep, then RSMRST# stays low, therefore the EC staying in reset state, although technically fully functional.

Hello. 
I have this argentine government issued laptop SF20PA2 v1.1. It was given to me in order to change the BIOS to bypass a block. Basically, the BIOS controls how many times the laptop has been turned ON, and if it doesn't connect to a certain certificate server, the laptop blocks itself and you have to enter a code. The code is no longer provided by the local education authorities and the servers are down.
Process is relatively simple, just flash the BIOS chip with a new one using the CH34

He showed me the display devices on device manager and there was only the igpu, he also got me more info about the history of the laptop, he said it has been tampered by other technicians at least 3 times, 1. Ram upgrade 2. The first one broke the screen flex and they had to install a new one 3. Replacing the thermal paste.

I replaced a thunderbolt controller on a lenovo once, idk what type of jhl chip it was, but docking and hdmi worked after that. Just be careful when you take the chip off the motherboard, because it is glued. You can easily tare off pads. Also be careful when cleaning the glue off the motherboard.

In the future, you can also download the VMD/RST setup app from Intel's or the OEM's site, extract the actual driver files, then inject the driver into an existing installation from recovery with `dism /Image:C:\ /Add-Driver /Driver:iaStorVD.inf` after first doing `drvload iaStorVD.inf` and mounting it in `diskpart`.

It’s theoretically possible that there is a certain portion of the BIOS that is device-specific included in the Boot Guard hash calculation which would explain why other images online aren’t working.

Inconsistent issues are normally caused by a bad connection. The source of a bad connection is most likely to be the solder balls beneath a large BGA chip like the CPU because it is the most susceptible to board twisting and general movement. Pressing down helps to temporarily rejoin any cracked balls, which may cause the fault to disappear while it is held.
