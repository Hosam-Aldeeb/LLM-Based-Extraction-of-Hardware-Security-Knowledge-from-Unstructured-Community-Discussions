I'm seeing 800Hz, not 19.5kHz. Now this could **entirely** be my error, but I can't find anywhere that the fixed PWM frequency is 19.5kHz. Are you sure?",

I'd need to dig into that code a bit.\n\nThe chip has no 'commands' really it just expects to be dumped data, it buffers 28 bytes worth and any overflow is passed out on it's SPI out port for daisy-chaining multiple chips together.\n\nThen if there's at least 8 clock cycles worth of delay in the SPI clock it'll check if the 6 MSB are a key value (100101b) then it latches all the data into the current PWM registers.\n\nIf you can directly write SPI data try writing this out MSB-first then set the SPI clock output low and stop sending basically:\n\n0x94, 0x5f, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00\n\nThat'll set it to internal oscillator, full current, and 50% PWM on all channels, so it should be easiest to check the PWM frequency then since it will be 50% duty cycle on everything.",
