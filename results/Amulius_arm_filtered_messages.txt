```
1. The Debug Interface (SWD/JTAG) is Affected by Clock Source Changes:

When you change the system clock source to PLL, it can also affect peripheral clocks, including the ones used by the SWD (Serial Wire Debug) or JTAG interface. In some cases, if the clock configuration isn't done properly or if the PLL isn't stable yet, it could cause the debug interface to malfunction or become non-functional, making it seem like the MCU is unresponsive.

3 things:
- check that your printf is redirected using the UART. google "printf uart redirection stm32" for details on how to do that
- measure the TX traces with your oscilloscope to verify that the data actually shows up on the wire. you also need to configure your gpio pins properly for that
- verify that the comport works, you can run an independent terminal tool, and short RX with TX on the board to create a loopback: everything you type should be eachoed to you

1) Take any STM32 board (Blue pill/Blackpill/nucleo). Set up a 100Hz timer (up counter) and see it on oscilloscope by outputing the value to DAC (If you have a scope)
2) When an overflow happens, read in data from any analog GPIO and transfer it by DMA to RAM
3) When the DMA transfer is complete, trigger an interrupt that will send the saved value via any available UART (You can choose the baud rate)
4) See the value transmitted by uart by displaying it in a serial terminal (You can connect from

the issue with the MIMXRT chips seems that you actually have to burn a fuse (not reset-able?) to change the interface between SWD and JTAG. Further reading shows there is some JTag command you can send to temporarily set the port to SWD as well once its burned to be JTAG but the chips are factory fresh and so still SWD.

Hi there, new to the community 🙂 I've found a Lexibook from the 2010s wich has an ARM Processor (compatible with linux) and a Windows CE in it. I want to hack the thing to install an embedded linux (like with buildroot or something). There is one problem. It's a locked up proprietary computer and i probably need to reverse engineer some things. I found the TX/RX serial port but no UART and it seems to have a security chip if i'm not mistaken ?

The thing has everything to be a good target to learn hacking it's having an EEPROM chip with 4Go of storage ant don't seem's to have any security. I'll take a good old usb/serial tool and hack it around whatever effort it takes because of the fun i get from it. It's really toxic from my perspective to discourage people saying that kind of rubbish. Thanks for the honesty but i'll take the hard way of learning hardware because it's my fun to hack and tinker computer things on my weekends.

Are the corruptions consistent? Do they have a pattern? I recently ran into an spi issue where the host was sending 3 bytes instead of the 4 the peripheral was expecting, so every other transmission was shifted. In my case the cs pin went low for the correct amount of time but the clock was only working for half of it. I guess it may also be good to verify if changing priority or clock speed affect this.

Okay using their words:
if Bootloader detects App Loader corruption then you lose DFU unless the App Loader corruption was caused by a botched App Loader update in which case you run the active App slot which will still contain the Updater which will then repair the App Loader (assuming the update itself is not the cause of fault)
======================================================================

[152] Similarity: 0.611 | cooperg2001 | 7/10/2025

[153] Similarity: 0.589 | cooperg2001 | 7/10/2025
Needing to load a seperate 2nd Stage updater into an app slot is fine.

If you want to protect against corruption then read up on your chips CRC, ECC, Write Protection, etc systems and implement an error checking and correction routine
======================================================================

[154] Similarity: 0.600 | cooperg2001 | 7/10/2025
The most basic way to prevent this is to include some magic number and a CRC with your firmware image.

The secure way is to do that but also encrypt it.

The first means at least someone bothered to give you a value to check

The second means only you or authorized parties can make firmware bundles that your device will load
======================================================================

[155] Similarity: 0.608 | cooperg2001 | 7/10/2025
if the only way for the device to get firmware updates is via some encrypted internet channel to  a server you control then this issue is mitigated. 

If you give out an update file they load the  you need more verification less they load some random garbage
======================================================================

[156] Similarity: 0.560 | cooperg2001 | 7/10/2025
Because if you don't verify whats going in there then it becomes much easier to brick your device or break DFU

if you tamper with the instruction stream somehow, because of the sparsity of the ISA you are very likely to end with an invalid instruction being decrypted and the CPU would then go into a secure illegal instruction trap

it should be mentioned that the security extension requires you to configure the SAU (and in some systems the IDAU); the former works more or less the same way as the MPU; you will need to have a veneer area, and you still need to rely switching the CPU from a secure mode to a non-secure mode

that is one big issue with code generators. you are relying on the blessing of ST, hoping that your particular path is not buggy. and there is no real timeline on that. this issue can take 5 minutes or 5 months. its a big risk. i would do these things not via the .ioc, but just use the peripheral (sai) directly, via its register settings. bit more work upfront, but its predictable and debugable

Again. JTAG/SWD and vcom are two separate topics. Implementing JTAG or SWD will not get you vcom.

Stlinks on nucleo boards have additional capability of translating a UART line into a vcom.

Standalone STlink V2 lacks this capability.
It looks like a standalone STLink V3 does have this capability.
And it could be that you can wire a UART into your nucleo board's STLink header for it to do the same.

But for this to be possible, in addition to the SWD lines, you must expose a UART line pair on y
