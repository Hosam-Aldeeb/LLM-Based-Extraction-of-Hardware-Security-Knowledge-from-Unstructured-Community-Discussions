A lot of people have had success following that.\n\nSo I Turned off the T-deck, Powered it on while holding down the middle/navigator button and hooked up the USB cable to my Windows PC. I see the device in my device manager and then I went to flasher.meshtastic.org and picked T-deck and picked the zip file I downloaded off om7tek's webpage and then hit Flash.\n\nI then confirmed full erase and install and clicked on Erase Flash and Install. Finally picked the USB device.\n\nAnd this is what came off it:\n\nesptool.js\nSerial port WebSerial VendorID 0x303a ProductID 0x1001\nConnecting....\nDetecting chip type... ESP32-S3\nChip is ESP32-S3\nFeatures: Wi-Fi,BLE,Embedded PSRAM 8MB (AP_3v3)\nCrystal is 40MHz\nMAC: 8c:bf:ea:06:88:2c\nUploading stub...\nRunning stub...\nStub running...\n\nAnd it stays there.

But SW3 might break off while you're attempting the upgrade. \nNo Worries\nThis worked perfectly, well, i'll go thru the flash steps for flashing without a SW3 button.  Hope you enjoy this. \n.....\n On your computer AND you cell phone.....\nBluetooth Settings ---> Perform \"FORGET\" on your Station G3's Bluetooth ID showing up in the list.\nUSB2 to USB-C cable to your Pee Cee, then you use the Chrome browser.\nStn G2---> Remove black metal cover (opposite the side with the screen). \nAdmire the circuit board 🙂\nChrome---> flasher.meshtastic.org website, pick Station G2\nOpen it, go past the agree page, choose full install but do NOT chose the web UI option. \nConnect USB cable\nPress & Hold SW2, and then single press SW3, Wait 5 sec and release\nIf SW3 button is missing, use flat head screwdriver to short the solder points of SW3\nAnd now the Station G2 is in the RST-Mode\nStart the flashing on the website. \nAfter it's done, you might have to single press (or short the solder points) briefly to get it out of RST mode.  \nUnplug USB to power down, plug back in. \nUse the iPhone Meshtastic app to do your new settings.  You can't diddle with the settings\non your Mac until you get done using iPhone. \nAll done, and your Station G2 will start kicking ass again. \nRemember to keep antenna connected.   Enjoy !!!\n."

Then it's just:\n\n```\ndfu-retry.bat COM3\n```\n(Adjust for the appropriate port)",
