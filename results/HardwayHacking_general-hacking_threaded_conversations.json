All you say is `Maybe I need the right exploits, which I have no idea where to find` which reads to me like you are wanting to find some sort of ready-made script or tool that is going to magically exploit the vulns for you.",

        "content": "You've hit on a really insightful point about how these attacks work! Yes, I understand CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks, and I can definitely explain the mechanics behind them, especially addressing your question about how external, malicious servers can seemingly gain the ability to send requests to a legitimate site.\nThink of it this way: when you're logged into a website (let's call it legit-bank.com), your browser holds a session cookie that acts like your digital ID. Every time your browser sends a request to legit-bank.com, this cookie is automatically included, proving to the server that it's you.\nNow, imagine a malicious website (evil-hacker.com) crafted by an attacker. This site contains some sneaky code – maybe an image tag with a src attribute or a hidden form – that, when your browser renders the page, triggers a request to legit-bank.com.\nHere's the crucial part: your browser will automatically attach the legit-bank.com session cookie to this request originating from evil-hacker.com!\nThe legit-bank.com server, upon receiving this request, sees a valid session cookie. It has no way of knowing that this request didn't actually originate from you performing an action on its own site. It just sees a request with your credentials.\nSo, to answer your question directly: the malicious server doesn't inherently have any special privileges to communicate with legit-bank.com. Instead, it tricks your browser into making the privileged request on its behalf, using your existing session cookie."

I purchased a pre-built system and integrated it into the game, but since I only have usage rights and not the source code, I’ve been doing a series of tests to better understand how it actually works.\n\nI’ve simulated different scenarios — even wrote a few basic drivers — to see how the protection responds. While I was able to bypass certain versions of it, there’s one specific layer I haven’t been able to overcome yet.\n\nI’m doing this not just out of curiosity, but because I want to fully understand the protection mechanism in order to modify and adapt it for my own server setup.\n\nIf anyone here has experience with reverse engineering or analyzing protection systems, I’d really appreciate any tips, tools, or general guidance you could offer.\n\nThanks in advance!"

To better prepare yourself for those future opportunities, I highly recommend you set aside time to learn the basic concepts behind all of these processes. Cybersecurity isn't about learning to use tools. Tools are irrelevant. If you don't understand what the tool you are using is actually doing, you're in a very bad place.",

All I am trying to say is that the language someone writes code in has nothing to do with the level of knowledge they have. \n\nMany times people will try to say that these two are related, and tell people that they NEED to, for example, learn C, if they want to be good at cybersecurity, or that they NEED to write their code in C if the want to be a \"good hacker\". This is not true, and is mainly just based in peoples' lack of understanding of things",

        "content": "(u can ignore this if u like)\n\nHi, this is not really a general hacking question, but more about \"if my OpSec in this app is already compromised by hackers\" question.\n\nI was in this mobile app game that I left 2 years ago but I have 4 years of playing since the start of the Pandemic (2020).\n\nMy question is, in this mobile application video game, I encountered around 3 years ago that someone had managed to bypass my clan's \"join system\", so there are 2 security measures in place. (Number 1) Did the player met the  requirements of the clan - Yes they do, (Number 2) Was the player authorized to join the clan, because keep in mind this clan sets the requirement to \"Request to join\" meaning if a high ranking member did not authorize the player to join regardless of whether or not they passed the clan's requirements, they are not allowed to join - to put it simply, they managed to join without this second requirement.\n\nSo, I just want to know what kind of exploit does it take to perform this action. \n\nand since then my clan's join requirements are already at the threshold that no player can achieve so even if I am away no one is able to perform this exploit again (most likely patched quietly by the developers)\n\nIn this same game people use Proxy Payments, specifically they use a different region to have a different price in their microtransactions (because some regions have a lower price than that in the U.S.)\n\nI asked Gemini first and it call it an \"Authorization Bypass\", and second is the \"Region Exploitation\" that bypasses Region Lock, Initiated a purchase, and Server Validation Failure.\n\nAt that time I never used a VPN because I do not know anything about Cybersecurity yet (LOL) and I actually used my personal email for this game. However, my concern is not that the developers know my identity, my concern is that if those who targeted me before has access to my personal data that is used to play that game.\n\nThank You!!"

I reckon they may all be the same person, if it is then calling them out would shut it down pretty quick I reckon.\n\nAs far as I know doing OSINT on cyber bullies is ethical, and I intend to stay ethical, I don't intend to doxx them or anything, I just want to use this as an opportunity to brush up on my cyber sec and maybe help a friend out at the same time, if you agree can you help me figure out which tools I can run to check which platforms or websites have this username?\n\nSo far I have consulted chatGPT and tried maigret, spiderfoot (passive), and sherlock - but these have all run dry for me every time.\nI think its something to do with the endpoints recognising that it is a bot and just returning no data.\nSo I assume running these tools vanilla is a deprecated method."

Ask around on any forum and people will always tell you to learn to use RAT's and keyloggers. To be honest I wouldn't recommend doing that straight away. I would advise to learn the basic terminologies of hacking (see section 6) and try to get an idea of exactly what everything means. It's really important to understand stuff before you go downloading random hacking programs from the Internet. It you don't know how to use them, or if they are viruses, you only have yourself to blame.\n\nif you ask me, just learn what hacking is I can give you a section to what it means. but check out the #⚡｜resources . \n\ngo with basics enjoy your time using linux,cli,nvim,,finger keyboards responsivilities, programing coding, screwing around with the computer. asking chat asking ai doing ideas. \n\nthen start the basic form of hacking which is computer hacking. it's the easier way to visualize the art of hacking.",

Well, whatishacking.org defines it as \"the practice of modifying the features of a system, in order to accomplish a goal outside of the creator's original purpose. The person who is consistently engaging in hacking activities, and has accepted hacking as a lifestyle and philosophy of their choice, is called a hacker. Computer hacking is the most popular form of hacking nowadays, especially in the field of computer security, but hacking exists in many other forms, such as phone hacking, brain hacking, etc. and it's not limited to either of them.\" - Taken from whatishacking.org That's a great definition but in my opinion hacking is much more than that. In my opinion, hacking isn't something you can just 'learn'. It's not just a skill, it's an art. Hacking requires knowledge. Knowledge is power. In order to gain said knowledge, and the power that comes with it, a change of lifestyle is required, along with a certain amount of secrecy. Learning 'how' to hack takes time and dedication. There's no easy way to get better at it. That's right, no shortcuts and its unlikely you're going to get a helping hand. Like everything else in life, it takes practice. Don't go crying to others if it doesn't work out, just keep calm and carry on. If you are serious about becoming a hacker, you will need to be willing to change your lifestyle, and dedicate yourself to the task. With enough dedication and hard work you will excel at hacking.\n\nDon't take those sections seriously they might or might not be correct. don't take my words seriously too they may or may not be correct.
