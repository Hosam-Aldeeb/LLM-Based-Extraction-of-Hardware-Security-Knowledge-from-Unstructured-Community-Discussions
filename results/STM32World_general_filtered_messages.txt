-write protocol for up to 16 devices (each address is 8 bytes long), I2C, SPI, an PLC protocol called Exoline (max packet size of 240 bytes). After shitload of optimization, I proudly had 1-bit in RAM marked "Reserved for Future Use" AND found a hardware bug (and figured out a workaround) that Microchip acknowledged (Intel refused to acknowledge it when we found a similar problem in the 1980 edition of the 8031, but had been fixed in the 1982 edition) and promised me 10,000pc pricing even if I o
