Fine, this is easy enough.\n\n_But_ if your ~~image~~ kernel happens to be uncompressed, for whatever reason, it will use it in-place. Meaning now your `load address + page size` has to be properly aligned for your CPU.\n\nIn my example with a non compressed kernel u-boot ignores `kernel_addr_r=0x82000000`, so I have to use `loadaddr=0x82000000 - my_page_size`.\n\n`loadaddr` is where my `boot.img`, or boot partition, is loaded.\n\nFinally, if the image is not using defaults it will use the ones you pass to `mkbootimg`. I pity the person who happens to specify one, but is for some reason using defaults lol. Rip their alignment.\n\nThis is very inconsistent IMO"

I'll try to show this as best I can, but I get a bunch of magic bitmask errors.\n\nFrom what I've looked into, at the front of each erase block it will look for that 0x1985. On the older kernel, it reads this correctly and I can mount and use QSPI with no issues. The second picture is what I get when I hexdump the partition. The third screenshot is what I get on the newer kernel.\n\nThe only difference is the 0x1985 vs 0x99C5.\n0x1985  = 0001 1001 1000 0101\n0x99C5 = **1**001 1001 **11**00 0101\n\nI tried `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mtd4` and after doing a hexdump, I get the fourth picture. So, the bits that I bolded above are always being read high for some reason. Here's the weird part: after doing this, I switched back to the old kernel and I correctly see all zeros. It doesn't read those bits as high. So, clearly, the writes are being done correctly. It's just that for some odd reason, only those bits are being misread.\n\nI've honestly never seen something like this before."

I don't remember what I did.\n\nI'm still getting magic bitmask failures but I did see strange results. Under certain conditions, it will read the bitmask correctly. I remember trying to boot from QSPI, the boot failed, I booted back from SD card with a changed max frequency in the device tree, and then it read correctly. However, when I erased the QSPI it went back to 0x99C5.\n\nIn some cases, it would read 0x19C5 instead of 0x1985.\n\nSo, I think it could be the SPI timing.\n\nJust for reference, in the old working kernel version, the max frequency was set to 133 MHz. And this lines up with what's stated in their [datasheet](https://www.mxic.com.tw/Lists/Datasheet/Attachments/8959/MX66L2G45G,%203V,%202Gb,%20v1.1.pdf), particularly Page 28.\n\nI'll keep lowering the frequency and let y'all know what I find.",
