Yours has 2 (12MB split across 2 X chips, 8MB + 4MB)```\nThe chip I shorted above was the 4MB one (MXIC 25L3273E), I don't have to do anything with the other one (MXIC 25L6473E), so how it's possible that this makes the motherboard work?\nDoing this \"trick\" allowed me to update the BIOS using the regular motherboard vendor tools running them from the same machine, but the problem persists, it won't POST normally by itself, it only works when shorting the CLK pin of the 4MB chip, any idea/suggestions?"

        "content": "I still have this problem I want to get back to it.\nMy theory at this point is that the BIOS bootblock is corrupted and by messing with the clock pin of the 4MB chip I'm forcing the motherboard to run an alternative code path which still works so it POSTs that way.\nThe bootblock is not normally written when you run the default vendor BIOS flashing tools, that's why performing a regular BIOS update didn't fix the issue.\nI tried to use intel FPT to flash the whole BIOS ROM but Lenovo added write-protection and I couldn't remove it via NVAR modding.\nI also tried to use an external programmer (CH341A) to flash the chips and it could not read/write, the 8MB chip (MX25L6473E) says this on its datasheet \"Permanently fixed QE bit, QE=1; and 4 I/O mode is enabled\" and \"The flash always performs Quad I/O mode\", which means that it can't be used as a simple SPI device (with single MOSI/MISO lines) because it's in permanent QuadEnable mode from factory; this greatly limits my options for external programmers.\nI even have another Haswell motherboard (MSI Z97 MATE) with what seems to be a corrupted BIOS too: it beeps when no RAM memory is inserted but with memory inserted (I've tested many modules on different slots) there are no beeps yet it doesn't POST, and while I don't have an oscilloscope at hand, when probing the clock pin of the BIOS chip with a multimeter I see constant activity. Unfortunately for me this 2nd mobo also has the same 8MB chip \"MX25L6473E\" 😦\nAt this point my *only option* to fix both motherboards is to power on the Lenovo mobo using the mentioned *trick*, somehow remove the write-protection on the original Lenovo BIOS (I know assembly x86/x64 but I have not modded any BIOS before) so I can use intel FPT for full ROM flashing, use it to hot-swap the MSI chip (so flashing the MSI BIOS while inserted on the Lenovo mobo), and with this one fixed then flash the Lenovo chip on its own mobo with a non-corrupted BIOS so it always POST by itself",

Reset the BIOS, kinda like poppin’ the hood and givin’ the ignition system a once-over. Pull the CMOS battery for a bit, slap it back in, and see if that fires up them USB ports.

If we do verify this as the issue and you just want to fix it and don't care about the root cause, you should just be able to remove the offending transistor(s).",

It's still possible that there is a communication loss because pin 1 for the gates I'm about to talk about comes from there, but I did some more research and found a schematic for a very similar board and someone with the same issue.\n\nIt looks like `SU3` and `SU4` are XOR gates that actually terminate the OC signal into the CPU. I found a thread on a Chinese repair forum (https://www.chinafix.com/thread-1378327-1-1.html) that mentions a bad pull-up resistor on pin 2 of those gates (`H_CORETYPE1`) causing this exact issue. I would check voltages on each of those pins, especially that pin 2. Not sure how likely it is that it's the same fault considering I think that would cause none of the ports to work, but we're still on the right track.",

For whatever reason, the signal must be taking too long to go high during POST when the firmware samples it.\n\nI'm not really an electrical engineer, but perhaps there is some \"rogue capacitance\" on the rail that it's charging? Maybe the easiest way to \"fix\" the board and maybe be a little dodgy is to just tie it high, but for the same reason of it being a high frequency signal I think a solder blob could throw it off.\n\nI'll try to think about it a bit more."

But it never freezes when you stay on Bios. Reprogrammed Bios ec with no help, tried different ram/disk/os still the same. It freezes also on bootable usb and does not read nvme disks during fresh installation even when given drivers. I am kinda lost and wonder if there is any solution to this problem. Next I am thinking of doing after approval is disabling gpu then on last resort, deep clean and reflow cpu chip. It came back to me I saw all these articles about a recent windows update causing problems with nvme drives not sure if it is related, also strangely I plugged my own system nvme drive with windows and when it started, Defender reported some kind of a trojan malware that infected the drive and also one of my usb keys. I immediately cleaned them on my linux system, which make me worry if it is some kind of firmware embedded malware, I really hope I'm wrong. Please let me know if anyone has a solution. the cpu and gpu seem to work fine with temp not exceeding 80 degree."

The thing which is funny is that clicking sound corresponds to the main power rail voltage constantly changing from 19v to 0v. \n\nDo you have an idea and what can be the issue ?\n\nThanks for your help"
