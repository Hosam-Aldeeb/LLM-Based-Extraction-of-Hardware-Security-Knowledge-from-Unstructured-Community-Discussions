However, I cannot find the correct repository for the coreMQTT Agent with the port to ESP-IDF (yes, coreMQTT Agent repo exists but it does not include ESP-IDF port).\n\nMy idea is to use coreMQTT with backOff algorithm to reconnect with exponential delays and then use the OTA Jobs to perform updates.",
