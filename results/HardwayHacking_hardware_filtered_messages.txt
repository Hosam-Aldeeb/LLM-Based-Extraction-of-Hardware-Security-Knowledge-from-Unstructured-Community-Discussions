Most things that you would do in ethical hacking would be fine running on anything more powerful than maybe a raspberry pi

could be stolen, could be bought off of ebay, no way of knowing. he is asking how to bypass windows bios/login which smells like against tos. if he has a proof of ownership he may be able to contact the seller or manufacturer for help

nothing to do here, you're in possession of stolen hardware, you can't unlock it without the company and they very likely want their laptop back don't you think?

and keep in mind it is illegal to tamper with electronics that don't belong to you, it depends on what you mean by "wipe" and how you do it

same with changing os or modifying firmware, in fact if it belongs to the school it most likely has a secure boot bios password

Yes, you're on the right track. Firmware repair typically uses chip programmers (like CH341A) with specialized software and correct firmware images. Your resources are good for learning. With practice, you could become a professional technician.

Thank you

Actually my hobby is just simple for now - to understand how to defend my laptop XD firmware reflashing is the sort of recovery phase if all defenses fail and a compromise happens

yooo,

So there's an even deeper form of spyware called hardware implants

Because it is implanted on the hardware itself, and its probably purely physical

Just buy from the right supplier and manufacturer though it should be almost zero

To put this in perspective, the chances of having compromised hardware are almost zero. Typically this is going to be something that is specifically targeted towards a device or entity. Most often it will be high-end networking equipment.
