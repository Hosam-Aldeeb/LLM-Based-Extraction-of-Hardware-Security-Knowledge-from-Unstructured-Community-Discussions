The ESP32 microcontroller on the dev board is drawing current from the voltage regulator on the board that supplies it's power. It draws a lot of current when using WiFi.
This regulator is also connected to the 3.3v pin which you previously had connected to the audio amplifier which was probably drawing enough current in combination with the ESP32 to damage the regulator or something else on the board.

I have seen multiple cases of parasitic powering due to a voltage being present on the microcontroller's I/O pins, which in turn have a I/O protection diode connected between them and e.g. 5V. And hence, voltage can leak in to the voltage net of the microcontroller's supply voltage.

I2C uses pull-up resistors to bring the signal lines "back up" to power, and each device on the line can choose to pull the line "low"

If you have stray capacitances, then this can slow down how fast the pull resistors can bring the line back up to a High logic level, which hard-limits your maximum clock rate.

The distance of the pull resistors to the sensor also dictates this. 
Some pre-made modules have the resistors built in, and can sometimes end up with too many pull resistors making the

be very careful when powering the relay's coils off your Arduino... powering it directly via its GPIO pins is __not recommended__ without additional circuitry to protect your microcontroller board

to test your hardware you don't even need an Uno
each resistor has one end on the 7 seg, the other end goes to a pin
if COM goes to ground you can connect a jumper from 5v to the end on each resistor that goes to a pin (disconnect from Uno first)
then you'll know which resistor is which segment (A - G and the decimal point)

And likewise even on the same frenqucy, there are many ways of encapsulates the message. So it can only pe picked up or transmitted by devices designed for that specific type of encapsulatesion.

And then across all of that you then can add digital channels. And digital kets to encode it.
So this is a HUGE habit hole.

But the arduino itself can still work if only that chip is broken.
You will need a second arduino or a USB-serial converter to upload new programs to the half-broken arduino or use the serial monitor with the half-broken arduino.
