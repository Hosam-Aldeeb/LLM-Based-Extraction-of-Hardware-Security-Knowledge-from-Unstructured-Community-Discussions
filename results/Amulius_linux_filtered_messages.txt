Think of the kernel as a layered architecture. You have your subsystems (I2C, SPI, PCIe...). For the subsystems to interact with the hardware, you need drivers for your hardware. You need to make your drivers and register them with that subsystem. Now, you have drivers that make use of a particular subsystem. For example, say that you're dealing with an SGP30 sensor. That is an air quality/chemical sensor. It uses I2C to communicate with your platform.
======================================================================

[79] Similarity: 0.584 | madman.in.a.box | 8/6/2025
In Linux, the driver for that is in the IIO subsystem. It registers itself in the IIO subsystem of the kernel, and it calls upon functions from the I2C subsystem to perform reads/writes to the sensor.
======================================================================

[80] Similarity: 0.597 | madman.in.a.box | 8/6/2025

you can go multiple ways:
- add an overlay at boot time to add the proper node(s) so that your device can be detected

if you add that to the device tree, you're telling the kernel to never shut off that regulator

when dealing with a GPIO regulator, the kernel will reserve the pin on the GPIO port you specified for regulator usage

Hi all, can you suggest projects to level up my Yocto skills?
I’ve been working with Embedded Linux/Yocto for ~1 year but feel like I’ve just scratched the surface.

Boards: BeagleBone Black, i.MX93, STM32MP157
Yocto: custom psplash logo, USB Wi-Fi, UART/TFTP, SSD1306 (I²C), ILI9341 (SPI), Weston/Sato + RDP
Boot: U-Boot, BusyBox, Buildroot

Next targets i plan to do, 
- Security: TrustZone/OP-TEE, Secure Boot, dm-verity
- Debug: GUI to drive GDB on A-core while debugging M-core (STM32MP157/i.MX9

can you link exact kernel sources? as I find only quick hacks to only pass through video from DRM system

dev_warn can be scrubbed from logs - see printk/dmesg/console settings

that and they steal open source code and reproduce it without attribution or licencing

short of trolling through git commits for the driver subdirectory, i would stat with git bisecting this because what a bizarro issue!

the device tree, and then it read correctly. However, when I erased the QSPI it went back to 0x99C5.

In some cases, it would read 0x19C5 instead of 0x1985.

So, I think it could be the SPI timing.

Just for reference, in the old working kernel version, the max frequency was set to 133 MHz. And this lines up with what's stated in their [datasheet](https://www.mxic.com.tw/Lists/Datasheet/Attachments/8959/MX66L2G45G,%203V,%202Gb,%20v1.1.pdf), particularly Page 28.

I'll keep lowering the frequency

looking at bindings and datasheet `256Mb Address Protocol` seems like needs futher investigation, "jedec,spi-nor" autodetection should work ok
