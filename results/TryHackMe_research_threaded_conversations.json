The attack could enable them to retrieve your key from the TPM. Because of this, some people prefer to use disk level encryption in the other configurations mentioned, where the key had to be either inserted, manually entered, or even delivered by a Tang server or bitlocker network unlock. These configurations can open a different attack surface, but they also prevent decryption by the more commonly known methods for retrieving keys from the TPM.",
