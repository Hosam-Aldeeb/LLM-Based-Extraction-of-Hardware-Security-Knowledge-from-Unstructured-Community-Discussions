        "content": "Funny. \"Resource constrained\" is anything less than an i386 in 1988. My first job inveolved writing an multi-task, real-time operating system, with language runtime and a serial comm network system. In 2kB RAM and 8kB EPROM (grew to 8kB RAM and 32kB EPROM in first product launch), on the 8031 (in the 8051 family mentioned above). And I went from that to making I/O devices in 1997 with a PIC16C73A, 4kB (actually 2,048 14bit wide) program memory and 192 bytes of RAM. Challenging to implement the 1-write protocol for up to 16 devices (each address is 8 bytes long), I2C, SPI, an PLC protocol called Exoline (max packet size of 240 bytes). After shitload of optimization, I proudly had 1-bit in RAM marked \"Reserved for Future Use\" AND found a hardware bug (and figured out a workaround) that Microchip acknowledged (Intel refused to acknowledge it when we found a similar problem in the 1980 edition of the 8031, but had been fixed in the 1982 edition) and promised me 10,000pc pricing even if I ordered smaller quantities for all future purchases. Those were days of \"constrained devices\".",
