It does not support partial upgrades without stuff breaking.\nHowever, the way I use my machine is that every now and then I want to install a single package, but otherwise keep the rest stable. Especially the glibc. I don't always want to update the whole system just because python went from 3.12 to 3.13.\nWhile I loved everything else about arch, especially gnome needed special treatment. Every second new version had a broken icon dependency where I had to hunt down some package to get the proper icons to appear in the menus again.\nAt some point, I was managing a custom ffmpeg version needed for a self compiled obs version (since upstream did not have the browser source as input) and that clashed with the system ffmpeg.\nSo at that point I got fed up. I wanted a stable version, so I went with Ubuntu Lts.\nNot a fan of the snap store, the older ones (Ubuntu 20) were less annoying in that regard, but hey, I can't have it all.\nGive me a rollingreleaseless arch or a snapless Ubuntu and I am happy.",

        "content": "Hi there, new to the community 🙂 I've found a Lexibook from the 2010s wich has an ARM Processor (compatible with linux) and a Windows CE in it. I want to hack the thing to install an embedded linux (like with buildroot or something). There is one problem. It's a locked up proprietary computer and i probably need to reverse engineer some things. I found the TX/RX serial port but no UART and it seems to have a security chip if i'm not mistaken ? (on the blue card next to the ethernet port, the little square chip)\n\nAs i am also a totally beginner at hardware hacking, i also want to learn the process and do the things the right way. Can you walk me throught ? Like what will i need to buy to make this thing and do you think it'll be possible on such board to achieve my goals 🙂\nOne thing i also want is to dump the whole Windows CE OS to make it public for conservation (if it's not illegal of course. Note that i didn't bought the device and never accepted their user agreements). I tried to reach the Lexibook teams but their website requires a serial number to contact support so nothing to get from them.\n\nThanks in advance !"

I already have a dad that is supportive to me for my projects and my professional experiences. Be like him in the future to others. PLEASE. That's toxic. I'll block you for that but i want to give you context (so you know who you are talking too). I'm a cybersecurity expert since three years as a  full autodidact, worked two years on mobile security and just had a elementary school degree in Electronics and telecommunication to begin with. So i have eaten a lot of android type shit and don't want anymore. My work is auditing windows programs (MSI, EXEs...) now. I also learn cryptography and math and i'm trying to create a hashing algorithm in C since three years on my free time because i love those things. To give you context it has been some years that i really want to do electronics again since it has been 10 years i got my degree and didn't solder anything. So i choose this project that is something personnal. The SBC is from an old child computer from my cousins that i want to hack. I need to relearn a lot of things to pursue the hacking and fun it gives me and for that purpose i want to learn more ROM hacks and hardware stuffs. That's all. Stop pursuing me for anything else rubbish you have to give. Just go boxing if you're embittered by what people says or think and be open and supportive for the people who love technology as you are. Peace and see you in another life.",

I think it is better to have a device you can control on the other side when learning...\n\nI think with one of these devices you would be able to build and see the full picture of the secure boot chain, including the proprietary bootloaders of the mediatek / qualcomm / broadcom / whatever chip, software like uboot / little kernel, trusted execution environment if one is needed, maybe hardware security chips like TPMs, trust zone of the chip, device trees and how they are signed (FIT), dm-verity and avb formats...\n\nI am not sure how I would tackle this as a beginner just with a device that is a secured black box that I would need to reverse engineer, to begin with most information about the black box device itself is probably behind paywall or innacessible"

I already have a dad that is supportive to me for my projects and my professional experiences. Be like him in the future to others. PLEASE. That's toxic. I'll block you for that but i want to give you context (so you know who you are talking too). I'm a cybersecurity expert since three years as a  full autodidact, worked two years on mobile security and just had a elementary school degree in Electronics and telecommunication to begin with. So i have eaten a lot of android type shit and don't want anymore. My work is auditing windows programs (MSI, EXEs...) now. I also learn cryptography and math and i'm trying to create a hashing algorithm in C since three years on my free time because i love those things. To give you context it has been some years that i really want to do electronics again since it has been 10 years i got my degree and didn't solder anything. So i choose this project that is something personnal. The SBC is from an old child computer from my cousins that i want to hack. I need to relearn a lot of things to pursue the hacking and fun it gives me and for that purpose i want to learn more ROM hacks and hardware stuffs. That's all. Stop pursuing me for anything else rubbish you have to give. Just go boxing if you're embittered by what people says or think and be open and supportive for the people who love technology as you are. Peace and see you in another life.",
