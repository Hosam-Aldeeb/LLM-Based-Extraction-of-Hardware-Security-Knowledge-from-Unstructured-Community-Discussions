You'd still need a regulator to supply a lower voltage since the 555 has a max of 15-16v depending on the variant, but you wouldn't need to worry about learning the whole \"how to flash a microcontroller\" and \"how to debug a microcontroller because nothing is working oh god help me please\". Using discrete transistors to just switch the LEDs on and off would require vanishinly few components and still be relatively easy to understand, though making it blink would require a few more to make a simple astable multivibrator. The bonus for that solution is that there would be no need for a down-regulated supply: it could all run at 24v with the right component choices."
