💬 [1] autumn12345 (6:47:47 AM)
anyone have any research or guidance on file level encryption vs drive level encryption? 

looking for things like why you’d choose drive level over file level for backups in particular

is general guidance “it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s encrypted”?

💬 [2] mknukn (7:56:10 AM) [REPLY]
quick thing off the top of my head is: drive-level encryption protects your files from physical access and file-level encryption protects your files from electronic access

💬 [3] zumiyumi (10:29:27 AM) [REPLY]
basically what mknukn said
for sysadmins and security folks we like to have drive level encryption for users because they forget their laptops in taxis all the time and it helps when an asset is lost and cannot be remotely wiped
the file encryption is good when you need to move files around and in case it gets intercepted or goes to the wrong person for whatever reason it adds an extra layer of security possibly

🎯 [4] so_much_for_subtlety (3:24:33 PM) [REPLY]
Yeah, disk-level encryption these days can take advantage of the TPM in your machine's motherboard, such as Bitlocker on Windows, or the LUKS disk encryption mechanism in Linux. File level encryption might allow you to store the keys elsewhere, such as on a USB stick to store the key, like with AES on a ZIP file; or using PGP to send/receive files through email (PKE, asychronous)

🎯 [5] xorist (3:58:52 PM) [REPLY]
Just adding a couple things I thought of as well related to this

An attack may be possible in some situations where the attacker has extended unrestricted access to your hardware. The attack could enable them to retrieve your key from the TPM. Because of this, some people prefer to use disk level encryption in the other configurations mentioned, where the key had to be either inserted, manually entered, or even delivered by a Tang server or bitlocker network unlock. These configurations can open a different attack surface, but they also prevent decryption by the more commonly known methods for retrieving keys from the TPM.

🎯 [6] so_much_for_subtlety (4:04:01 PM) [REPLY]
An excellent point. Encryption and key security/management require the use of other tools/techniques to safeguard your systems. You could do something like hosting the user's work desktop on a cloud server (pub/priv) and require a vpn key on an external device or dot1x system in the office to allow a dumb/limited laptop to connect to the network

💬 [7] so_much_for_subtlety (4:08:29 PM)
You can also require encrypted usb keys and control/manage the keys centrally for file transport. So if you had to physically transport a sensitive file to a restricted/air-gapped location, for instance, key management for the usb key and file can be maintained securely and access can be very tightly controlled

Tracking an NK campaign right now, someone in here reached out with a file malwarebytes detected as a stealer, turned out to be invisibleferret - worked with victim to find the initial IOC and started tracking a multitude of LI profiles spreading beavertail + invisibleferret combo through contagious interviews, almost all of them are crypto related and ask the interviewee/victim to run a node project, usually some boilerplate web app with an exec snuck in that executes obfuscated node (beavertail) within a PNG 

will likely soon have a research article and TTP/IOC report on our blog but Unit42 also covered this very well: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/

guys i found something interesting, is there a way for a phone on your network to declare itself as a router and appear as one in ipv6 neighbor discovery?, i ran the network through wire shark and it seems there is a device spoofing requests trying to look like my router with smaller differences to the mac address


also i blocked upnp request on my router a few days ago because it seemed like i am getting DDoSed from all of my IoT devices, so now i get a ton of port 5353 request instead by the same volume

also there was a suspicious address trying to access SMB today which i have never seen before 

all of these got blocked of course, but the only devices that were acting weird is that phone that appears as a router, and another computer that can traceroute other devices, but you can't ping that computer or traceroute it, sounds like a man in the middle attack with a rouge router, i might be looking too much into things but i did get an arp poisoning alert from that same phone when the issues started, plus there a hefty amount of arp requests in the wireshark sniffing i did before

Hello everyone, I have a question: would anyone be willing to take a look at a vulnerability report I created earlier this year? 

It’s based around an audio exploit I caught in the wild and reversed engineered. I sent the report & exploit to Google’s research team on April 11th and on April 16th, Apple pushed out emergency patches that match the description of the report provided and accredited Google. 

I found what I believe is a hardware flaw on the iPhone and would like an opinion of whether I am missing the mark or not..?

I found that fileName parameters in the ms-photos URI handler supports UNC paths. 

Combined with a server redirection, it allows to leak NTLM hashes, with a one click condition (open photos popup) from any browser. 

This combination could allow wide supply chain attacks, since it moves from a browser redirection to NTLM hashes leak. 

Find more details and a POC about it

i am a newer cybersecurity student, but has anyone crafted steps towards remediation?

💬 [3] n_440 (7:15:34 PM) [REPLY]
Yes it was patched finally by Microsoft 
For non patched environments disable SMB outbound connections if not needed, especially for public IPs on firewall

Hi! Happy to share it with you

Microsoft blocks VBS macros on retrieved word document templates, even in a local intranet networks, to prevent phishing 

I found a way to bypass it on local networks, using LLMNR poisoning. Can be useful for local phishing assessments! 

Microsoft didn’t recognise it and there is no patch

Did you stumble upon this exploit or were you kinda digging for it already?

🎯 [3] n_440 (11:03:52 AM) [REPLY]
I found it while researching about a new MOTW bypass I found on Intranet

💬 [4] n_440 (11:06:03 AM) [REPLY]
This one

💬 [5] strike_37099 (1:57:50 PM) [REPLY]
I'm still quite new and networking is not strong suit, what is Mark of the web bypass exactly? And did you use burp suite or custom tooling for LLMNR poisoning?

💬 [6] n_440 (6:38:27 PM) [REPLY]
You should read about it in MSDN and learn about these things in THM rooms 🙂 
You will understand it better

💬 [7] strike_37099 (7:19:27 PM) [REPLY]
Understood, thank you for pointing me in the right direction!

Yea... 
It because i am planning to build an unbreakable antivirus.....
It can be impossible but until i see what make it impossible....
To learn why it is impossible i need data about the common things of malware... M

Hi everyone,

I’m an ISC2 CC-certified cybersecurity undergrad( final year) with solid theoretical knowledge and intermediate Python skills. 

Looking for Final Year Project (FYP) ideas that are feasible, doable, and novel  in cybersecurity.
Please share your thoughts 🍀

Is wsl good for hacking ?(I have a old laptop which only has one port so I can't boot into kali Linux)

💬 [2] wizarddos (11:55:29 AM) [REPLY]
It's pretty mid - Though you most def can run kali here. Doesn't it have like a CD slot or sm?

💬 [3] whyme33 (10:00:44 PM) [REPLY]
Nah no cd slots just a mini displayport and a regular usb 2.0 port
