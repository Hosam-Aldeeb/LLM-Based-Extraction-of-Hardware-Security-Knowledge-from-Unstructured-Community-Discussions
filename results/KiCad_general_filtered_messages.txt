The main problem with the CH569W reverse engineering was that they didn’t include the register map for the USB3- functionality in the documentation. So it was a real detective work!

There's an RS232 driver and a couple of RS422/RS485 drivers, OPO7 low-offset comparator, 74HC595, a few LDOs and buck converters, TVS and other protection diode devices, lots of diodes, transistors (incl ULN2003 octal array) and FETs, including high-current (>4A) PFET and NFETs, a few different op-amps, crystals, even a 16MByte SPI Flash chip. Obviously a selection of different R's (including 4-way arrays) and C's from 0402 up to 1206, and capacitors up to 50uF

So using a mosfet here kind of opens up a little bit of a can of worms. They're ESD sensitive and they can have some unintuitive behaviour if you're new to electronics and are just expecting them to magically work. Using a BJT here, either a very ordinary 2n2222 if your load current is under 500mA or maybe a TIP41 if you need a bit more current, will simplify things a lot.

A circuit like this with BJTs would be sufficient for your application (you can add power input protection as you see fit)
