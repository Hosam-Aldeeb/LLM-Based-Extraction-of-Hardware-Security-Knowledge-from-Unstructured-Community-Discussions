i2c is the low level protocol used by those peripherals. However, having only i2c implemented on the MiSTer is not enough to make them work on it. Someone needs to implement also the high level protocol (i.e., how i2c data is interpreted by the MiSTer).

there's usually a button combination to change what the dongle is spoofing iirc

I have a defender that's rather old and it has analog triggers. And these triggers are super sensitive when used on original hardware.

This is interesting: the one that works at 31 kHz, WinGun, has a manual calibration step where you sweep the gun from side to side. If it detects that your x reading is doubled-up, it just hacks in a correction for that

is it much different than what JT does for example? except the roms are newer

For at least Ultimate 2.4g wireless: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnanvaH7B10

Doesn't seem to be undocumented since its mentioned in the release notes for the firmware

Not that I’ve seen, seems like trial and error; worse yet is many resources recommend dongles that use a chipset no longer easily obtainable
