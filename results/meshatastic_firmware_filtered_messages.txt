Yea that's what I read from the comments in the source code too, Just wanted to make sure the acks are not used for something really important. We got a big network here and we had the issue, when someone was reciving a lot of messages,the node acts like a ddos enhancer and spams the network full with delivery messages or acks. Hence modifing the firmware to make it stop sending any acks, when doing so, also stumbled across the package priorities.

Should I open a github issue or could you include a rate limiter, how many ack's a node is sending out, in case of a lot of inbound messages? So it doesn't act as a ddos emplifier

This is an interesting idea, it's probably possible to emulate the ch341 protocol in firmware on the esp32 using the USB peripheral. Only problem is the heltec doesn't expose the ESP32's usb pins on the USB port. They have a USB to serial converter so you'd have to hack up a USB cable and connect it to different pins. Some of the Lilygo boards have USB exposed.

Interesting. Not a single "Invalid" in the log. Finally got it saved now over ble by disable -> set config -> enable. Could not actually change any option over any non-serial transport and plain disable only went through ble. Bizarre. I guess I can't trust the syslog and need to finish the "esp32 serial port to syslog" monstrosity.

Q: Why is esp32Setup() called after I2C sensor detection?
The WDG is enabled in esp32Setup(), therefore there is a possibility that a broken I2C driver can crash the device. I might be wrong, though.

Edit. Probably, because you don't know how much time it would take to initialise all I2C devices and GPS, but shouldn't  90s WDG be enough?

There are some rough edges in the meshtastic firmware around power measurement/deep sleep if you’re using an i2c device to measure power (basically i2c isn’t initialized yet when the firmware checks to see if it should deep sleep) but overall it’s not bad

I'm not sure it's myopic to limit the power to the legal limit - but then again I am myopic, so perhaps I can't see it!

Fwiw, some of the radios won't just break the law if set too high - they'll actively damage themselves. The manufacturer relies on the application developer (i.e. Meshtastic) to implement software controls. If there was an override switch for users, outside of recompiling, how would you communicate that risk?

I think mikrotik has the right approach here. They expose a setting for "antenna-gain" that is used to calculate eirp (and clamp to the regdb limit). 

Exposing a similar setting in meshtastic would help to ensure people with an 11dbi antenna are not "accidentally" exceeding the legal limit. The same setting could also be used for insertion loss. 

Hiding the setting (hidden command, custom firmware, etc) not only penalizes g2 users but it also makes it too easy for anyone with an 11dbi antenna

I have 2 suggestions, if you want to use this and incorporate it into the main repo:
1) find an i2c sensor, and add that. I2c sensors are easy to add and daisy chain for everyone.
2) make a separate module that can be optionally included in a firmware build. The more space-constrained devices should be protected from including modules by default.
