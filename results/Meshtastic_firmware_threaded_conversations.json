I've successfully loaded the firmware project in CLion IDE and can compile it without errors.\n\nNow I'd like to set up proper debugging with breakpoints and other standard debugging tools. My question is:\n\nIs there a way to simulate or mock the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) for debugging purposes?\n\nI found this statement on the official PlatformIO website which confused me:\n\"Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) does not have on-board debug probe and IS NOT READY for debugging. You will need to use/buy one of external probe listed below.\"\n\nHas anyone found a workaround for this, or do I definitely need to purchase an external debug probe?\n\nThanks for any guidance!"

For instance, someone has physical access to one of my nodes, and is able to simply pair via bluetooth and retreive my messages from the last [x] hours/days, along with my encryption keys and other items of interest. \n\nIt just seems odd that there isn't an optional passcode requirement for connecting to a node. Ideally it would require a full wipe of the device if you lose a passcode, for instance. For the narrow band of use-cases of Meshtastic nodes, I think that this is a fairly critical item."

Due to client requirements, we are using a custom hardware platform based on **AT32 microcontroller + SX1262 LoRa module** instead of the commonly used RAK4630.\n\nWe’re reaching out to the community for guidance on how best to adapt the Meshtastic firmware for our hardware. Specifically, we’d like to understand:\n\n1. **Which parts of the firmware need to be modified** to support the AT32 MCU.\n\n2. **How to decouple or replace the HAL and middleware layers**, especially for SPI, GPIO, and interrupt handling.\n\n3. Whether there are **any references** or best practices from community/others who have ported Meshtastic to non-supported platforms.\n\n4. Any considerations or known limitations we should be aware of while working with SX1262 on non-standard platforms.\n\nWe’re comfortable handling the hardware-specific development but would appreciate any help, suggestions, or documentation pointers from the community to ensure we go about this the right way.\n\nThanks in advance for your support!"

The double-tap to send position/node-info will be replaced with that option elsewhere, as the UI develops.\n2) There are ways to tweak the firmware to adjust the rate limits for various actions. I'm not going to link you to how to do it.\n\nWith regards to your use case, you've explained that:\n> I'm working up here on a tower and trying to optimize aiming antennas or evaluating a path NOT on any main or being used mesh. On its own dedicated frequency away from any populated mesh.\n> I'm also at other times on a building top needing to test an RF path between building sites with dynamically changing on air noise and need to be able to check the RF path quickly and multiple times while testing under varying conditions that change quickly.\n\nThe function you are using to perform these tests is not intended for that purpose. There are other tools for the task that you are doing that do not require modification of the firmware. If you have access to the other end (the one that you are evaluating the path to) then range-test is able to be set remotely, and the pings can be evaluated for signal strength as they arrive. If the other node is more than 1 hop away, traceroute is a more appropriate tool.\n\nIf you feel there is a tool or function that would be better than these, please suggest it.",

We use Rak4631-based boards, and with an RS485 module, support mixed wireless/wired links (packets can go wireless, hop on a wire, exit out and go back to wireless).  Incoming wireless packets are echoed out the RS485 link, incoming packets from the RS485 interface are echoed out the wireless interface. We have a [Meshtastic repo branch](https://github.com/rbreesems/firmware/tree/may2025)  and [supplement utility repo](https://github.com/rbreesems/flamingo).   The RS485 capability is implemented in the firmware using a #conditional that replaces the existing SerialModule code with our RS485 code --  the only setting used from the SerialModule is baud rate. There are only a couple of files outside of the serial module code that need minor modifications to pass packets from the wireless interface to the RS485 interface. Given all of this, is there any desire for this capability to be merged into the main code? If yes, I will work on a pull request - and I assume that the current #conditional approach for the SerialModule would need to be altered, I guess a new module would be needed, but it would still pull the baud rate from the serial module setting. FYI, the current code works under 2.5 and 2.6.  Our branch has several other changes, but only the RS485 code would be in the PR."

You are welcome to change it, but as a consumer as well as a developer i'd expect that it's unlikely something like that would end up in the main distribution.",
