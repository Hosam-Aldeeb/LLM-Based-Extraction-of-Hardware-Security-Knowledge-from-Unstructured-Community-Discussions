Ahoy. If the drive detects (for example) as VAM52JBZ in MHDD or HDAT2 and shows as 0 capacity instead of VAM51JJ0 what is on it's label then the drive has firmware corruption what you can't repair at home.

I also tried to use an external programmer (CH341A) to flash the chips and it could not read/write, the 8MB chip (MX25L6473E) says this on its datasheet "Permanently fixed QE bit, QE=1; and 4 I/O mode is enabled" and "The flash always performs Quad I/O mode", which means that it can't be used as a simple SPI device (with single MOSI/MISO lines) because it's in permanent QuadEnable mode from factory; this greatly limits my options for external

the USB ports ain’t workin’, could be the BIOS is actin’ up—kinda like when yer truck’s ignition switch ain’t sendin’ power to the starter. Sometimes, the BIOS has security settings that shut off the USB ports, just like how a bad ignition switch won’t let the truck crank even if the battery’s fine. Best thing to do? Reset the BIOS, kinda like poppin’ the hood and givin’ the ignition system a once-over. Pull the CMOS battery for a bit, slap it back in, and see if that fires up them USB ports. If

I guess the IC is fault, 5v on input pin, 3v on enble pin and 0v on output pin
So u can jump a wire from 5v input pin to output pin
Before do that make sure output pin not shorted to ground, and output pin connected to 5v pin on USB port

Maybe somewhere one trace from the current sense to the monitoring chip is lost. Could be a cracked solder joint for all we know. Plus I am making about a million and one assumptions about how this is actually designed, so that could be entirely the wrong path. Need a schematic and boardview to take that much further.

Okay, so that means that `S_USB3_OC#34_R` is being pulled low (active) somewhere. Following that signal will lead us to our issue. Though, to verify this you can try shorting pins 4 and 5 on `SU3` then the board should boot fine.
======================================================================

[11] Similarity: 0.564 | codeconnoisseur | 3/3/2025
No, you don't have to remove `SU3`. Try measuring the voltage on `UCR197`, `UR166`, and `UR181`; perhaps we have multiple signals being pulled low. The CPU seems to handle two of the USB 3 OC signals but the chipset handles the rest. Also check that `PMR82`, `PMR83`, `PMR84`, `PMR85`, and `PMR130` are all present as they look to be pull-ups for unused signals.

CPU: `S_USB3_OC#34` (`SU3`), `S_USB3_OC#56` (`SU4`)
Chipset: `S_USB3_OC#12` (`UR181`), `S_USB3D1_OC#12` (`UCR197`), `S_USB_OC_#3456` (`U

In such cases you should measure resistance to GND of VGT to get a possible clue. If it measures lower compared to CORE you will immediately know that the CPU is fried on this rail.

Of course, CPUs themselves and any kind of microcontroller literally provide JTAG debugging capability, but some hardware hacking may be needed and the tooling and experience needed would not be worth it.

You can also try applying downwards pressure on the chipset before, during, and after boot to rule out some BGA fault there. The USB OC signals are near one of the corners which are the most likely areas to have cracked balls.
