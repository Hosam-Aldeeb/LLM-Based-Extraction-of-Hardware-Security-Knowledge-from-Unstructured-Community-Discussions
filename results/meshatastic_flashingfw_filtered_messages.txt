hrmmm, just pulled latest and recompiled + reflashed... it's something with the i2c pins:```//\ E S H T /\ S T / C

It's currently only available by building the firmware yourself.  There are instructions pinned in #mui.  Once it's ready for mass testing it will be released in the online flasher.

icked on Erase Flash and Install. Finally picked the USB device.

And this is what came off it:

esptool.js

Connecting....
Detecting chip type... ESP32-S3
Chip is ESP32-S3

Crystal is 40MHz

And it stays there. Any suggestions on what I can try? 🙂

 head screwdriver to short the solder points of SW3
And now the Station G2 is in the RST-Mode
Start the flashing on the website. 
After it's done, you might have to single press (or short the solder points) briefly to get it out of RST mode.  
Unplug USB to power down, plug back in. 
Use the iPhone Meshtastic app to do your new settings.  You can't diddle with the settings
on your Mac until you get done using iPhone. 
All done, and your Station G2 will start kicking ass again. 
Remember to keep

Not sure if a "factory wipe" of the flash would help you-

Well, keep in mind that some devices show up as /dev/ttyUSB* (such as a Heltec LoRa 32V3) and some as /dev/ttyACM* (such as a Wisblock 4631). It depends on the type of USB<-->serial adapter the device is using. As such, you need to make sure you're passing the correct devices over to your VMs.

Also, if you're using the web flasher direct to the USB ports, note that some browsers have broken connections to the serial devices. Chromium-based browsers seem to have the best luck. Personally, I use

The vast majority of devices run on open source firmware, there is even open firmware being worked on for the t-deck. Nothing stops anyone from developing open versions of the firmware for the currently closed devices and apps. Let the best approaches survive.
