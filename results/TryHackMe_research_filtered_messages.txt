Yeah, disk-level encryption these days can take advantage of the TPM in your machine's motherboard, such as Bitlocker on Windows, or the LUKS disk encryption mechanism in Linux. File level encryption might allow you to store the keys elsewhere, such as on a USB stick to store the key, like with AES on a ZIP file; or using PGP to send/receive files through email (PKE, asychronous)

Just adding a couple things I thought of as well related to this

An attack may be possible in some situations where the attacker has extended unrestricted access to your hardware. The attack could enable them to retrieve your key from the TPM. Because of this, some people prefer to use disk level encryption in the other configurations mentioned, where the key had to be either inserted, manually entered, or even delivered by a Tang server or bitlocker network unlock. These configurations can ope

An excellent point. Encryption and key security/management require the use of other tools/techniques to safeguard your systems. You could do something like hosting the user's work desktop on a cloud server (pub/priv) and require a vpn key on an external device or dot1x system in the office to allow a dumb/limited laptop to connect to the network

Awesome analysis! I'd definitely like to come back to this post as a later point and see if this Malware creator is behind any other of the popular malware scripts.

It's actually incredibly common for Roblox DLL injectors and scripts to actually be malicious.
Something about Solara is that it actually was a real 'legitimate' cheat but, if I remember correctly, someone created their own fake Discord and started distributing a fake version.

I found that fileName parameters in the ms-photos URI handler supports UNC paths. 

Combined with a server redirection, it allows to leak NTLM hashes, with a one click condition (open photos popup) from any browser. 

This combination could allow wide supply chain attacks, since it moves from a browser redirection to NTLM hashes leak. 

Find more details and a POC about it
