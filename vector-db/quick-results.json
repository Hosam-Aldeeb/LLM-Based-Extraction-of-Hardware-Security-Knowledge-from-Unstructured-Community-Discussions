      "report": "### 1. JTAG Debugging\n- **Use Case:** When needing to debug microcontrollers or embedded systems at a low level, particularly when dealing with complex issues that cannot be resolved through higher-level debugging.\n- **Tools:** JTAG programmer/debugger (e.g., ST-Link, J-Link).\n- **Description:** JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) allows for direct access to the microcontroller's internals, enabling developers to halt execution, inspect memory, and set breakpoints. This is particularly useful for diagnosing issues in firmware or hardware interactions that are not apparent through standard testing.\n- **Source:** Defcon_hw-hacks\n\n### 2. SWD (Serial Wire Debug) Protocol\n- **Use Case:** Ideal for programming and debugging ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, especially when pin count is limited.\n- **Tools:** SWD programmer (e.g., ST-Link, J-Link).\n- **Description:** SWD is a two-pin interface that allows for debugging and programming of ARM Cortex-M devices. It is less complex than JTAG, making it suitable for smaller projects where space is a concern. Developers can use it to set breakpoints and monitor variable states in real-time.\n- **Source:** STM32World_hardware\n\n### 3. Logic Analyzer\n- **Use Case:** Useful for analyzing digital signals and communication protocols to troubleshoot timing issues or data corruption.\n- **Tools:** Logic analyzer (e.g., Saleae Logic, OpenBench Logic Sniffer).\n- **Description:** A logic analyzer captures and displays multiple signals from a digital circuit. It allows developers to visualize the timing of signals and decode communication protocols like I2C, SPI, or UART, making it easier to identify issues in data transmission or signal integrity.\n- **Source:** Adafruit_helpwithhwdesign\n\n### 4. Multimeter Testing\n- **Use Case:** Essential for verifying voltage levels, continuity, and resistance in circuits during troubleshooting.\n- **Tools:** Digital multimeter (DMM).\n- **Description:** A multimeter is a versatile tool used to measure voltage, current, and resistance. It can help identify shorts, open circuits, and incorrect voltage levels in a PCB, providing critical insights into hardware failures or misconfigurations.\n- **Source:** Adafruit_helpwithhwdesign\n\n### 5. Oscilloscope\n- **Use Case:** Critical for visualizing analog signals and diagnosing issues with signal integrity, timing, and noise.\n- **Tools:** Digital oscilloscope.\n- **Description:** An oscilloscope allows developers to observe the waveform of electrical signals. By analyzing the shape, frequency, and amplitude of signals, engineers can troubleshoot issues related to timing, noise, and signal degradation that may affect the performance of their designs.\n- **Source:** Defcon_hw-hacks"
