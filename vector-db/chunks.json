The first section is some early boot, and I see this matches bit for bit the same named section in the firmware update blob for newer firmwares; namely starting at 6.6.65. The next section is where the update failed, the first half of it matches newer firmware update blobs for that section, then the glitchy sector, then the rest of the content matches older firmware update blobs, from < 6.5.x\n\nUnfortunately, I can't pin down a single firmware release.

So far I am building a project on a breadboard, though I have come to realize that the microcontroller I am using (ESP32 Nano), cannot output greater than 3.3v. \n\nHowever one of my relays is rated for 5V. This is fine however as I am using an external power supply at 5V that powers the esp, and the relay (but uses an NPN to take a 3.3v digital signal from the esp and complete the circuit from the relay to the power supply.\n\nThis works fine! But it means I have to use a power supply and not USBC, as I am aware that the ESP can only output 3.3v, I cannot get 5V unless I use a powersupply.\n\nHowever I am looking to add a standalone USBC connector which powers both the esp and the relay. I was wondering if there are anyways to regulate the input voltage to ensure it stays at 5V, as I am aware USBC can go higher than 5V",

If the ESP draws 100 mA that means the package is going to be dissipating 700 mW through that little tab to the small amount of copper you put on the PCB. \n\nYour traces should have had the load coming from Pin 2 with the tab going to a large copper area. \n\nThat said, Dr. Lui did some testing of that part (compared to an AMS1117) and found it was more robust.

If you're using the least sensitive version of the EL357 (the \"N\" one), it has a minimum current transfer ratio of 50%, so you'd need to push 500µA through the LED.

The current clamps would be going over the hot wire on my washing machine and dryer, which obviously have a decent current draw. I did an experiment before with a diode bridge but the generated voltage was too high for the analog gpio on the ESP obviously. If I merely ran a voltage divider with some resistors to get down < 3.3V am I *safe* or shouold I approach with some other method?",

It seems you should only do the DC SSR if you really care about electrical isolation, because there is a slower response and higher resistance, but my problem is I don't know how much I care about electrical isolation.

Sure enough, I get a lot of noise when reading the ADC values and while I've been able to mitigate it in software pretty well, I'm looking at updating my circuit design to include an additional RC filter (I already have one as part of input/feedback for the op-amp).\n\nTrouble is finding the value of the RC doesn't seem trivial since it depends on the choice of op-amp (MCP6002 in my current case) and how the SAMD51 is setup. This seems to require using something more than Falstad to simulate, basically needing something like LT Spice which has me a little far out of my previous comfort zone.\n\nCurious if anyone has guideance?

But I don't know of any module that specifically uses a SAR ADC (they may exist, I just don't know which ones). Or perhaps I'm getting nailed by the precision issue you mentioned.\n\nOne thing I did try was a slightly larger cap (560 pF vs 330, and switching from ceramic to film) for the op-amp low-pass to filter out HF noise. I think it made an improvement? But I haven't tested it without averaging. Before, there were definitely voltages (so pitches since V/Oct) which were noisier than others.

The comical bit which threw me off sooo much with these SAR ADCs is the signal I'm sampling is low frequency. I didn't plan for supporting audio-rate feedback type stuff so the V/Oct sampling could be as low as like 50Hz and still be acceptable. A majority of the time the signal is static even, outside of things like pitch slides or making drum sounds. So the op-amp filter can use quite a low low-pass, but the RC for the SAR seems to be much much higher (since it's for the SAR side, not the op-amp side).\n\nIt's a clever and effective design so I have no ill against it other than it adding a level of complexity I wasn't prepared for haha.",

The idea is to include a motor that can be used as an input device  by turning it manually, as well as an output device by controlling it with a pico. Trying to find the best hardware to approach it. I can see it done here: https://github.com/peng-zhihui/HelloWord-Keyboard\nwith some Hall effect sensors providing encoder feedback on a brushless drone motor (2204-200kv) but I can’t source that part anywhere. I looked into feedback servos and could get it done with only 180 degrees of motion (think rocker switches) but the full 360 degrees of a regular DC motor (like the 6V adafruit dc motor with encoder) really appeals to me. Stepper motors with encoders could also work, but I’m unsure. Anyone have any thoughts?",

But it only works with a usb-A to usb-c cable. \n\nI have been reading and what I have gathered is that for it to work with usb-c and a wall charger, I should add 5.1k resistors on the two CC pins. I got a new usb-c female port that has V, GND, several data pins and the CC1 and CC2. I put resistors connected to the CC ports and ground, then connected GND and V to my board, and it still didn't work. The cable is a known good one, and the same setup works with a usb-a to c still\n\nWhat am I missing? I really want my finished project to have a nice usb-c port for power rather than using the barrel jack.",

I've been setting the height and thickness because I'm ordering through JLC PCB and they have the minimum height and line thickness on their specifications. So I think that's why they actually have those parameters instead of a font size, because the manufacturers will actually have limits for the height and thickness, whereas a font point size can vary a lot based on the actual font",

The MOSFET is connected in-line with the power so that it will turn on if the polarity is correct and turn off if it is reversed. Cutting the right leg breaks the connection to the power rail for the servos.\nIf the solder pads from the MOSFET are not destroyed, you could also bypass it by soldering a jumper from the tab to the right-side leg.\"\n\nI assume I can solder the +V from the DC barrel input to where the mosfet leg was soldered to?",

After days of troubleshooting and experimentation, I moved to a UM Feather S3 and Adafruit Matrix Featherwing, which didn't seem to have the issue. But I ran into an issue in that the 64x32 LED matrix display glitchy for some pixels (up until now I had only been displaying a solid color on the whole panel). I tried two different panels. Finally I tried one of the glitchy panels with the MatrixPortal S3, and it seems to be okay.\n\nI'm wondering if that's because the MatrixPortalS3 has level shifters on the HUB75 interface, and the FeatherWing does not?",

It's to solve the problem I constantly have, one battery, have to power a 3.3V board, and 5V LCD , board cant output 5V on a pin, logic level problem already solved and I dont want to have to make another circuit outside for the step-up the chip should handle everyhting and I should be able to also use it to replace the LCD with a 5V arduino too (hence the 800mA and 200mA (these are the two choices))",

There's a bit in the datasheet that's confusing me, on page 9 there's a note about why a voltage divider is needed for the VBUS pin. However the reasons it cites for using one don't make sense to me. From what I understand (which could very well be wrong), It basically says its using a voltage divider to stay below the pins max voltage rating while also staying above the minimum high detection voltage.\n\nMy issue is in a typical application, of 3.3v VIO and using the formulas in the datasheet, I don't see how it goes out of bounds of the ratings. Am I misunderstanding the datasheet or in a 3.3v VIO application the voltage divider is unnecessary?  My other issue is I was using a esp32 dev board as a reference design and on their cp2102, they have the voltage divider and I don't understand why its there. \n\nhere is a link to the datasheet. https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/cp2102n-datasheet",

What would happen if I plugged in the charging cable whilst the OUT was conneced to the arduino nano? Some of the amazon listings say to not charge at the same time as using the output, what would happen if I did this and are there variants which could support pass through in the scenario where the usb cable is connected?",

For Arduino I used a DAC(Digital  to Analog module[12 bit]{MCP4725}).\nWhile doing research I saw that ESP32 also supports DAC output 8bit(enough for me) .\n\nThing is Arduino is 5v so my analog output was 5v, which was perfect, but with esp32 its 3.3v tops. Any suggestions?\n\nShould I...\na) Go back to DAC and try to use a txs0108e for the I2C comunication ( -# I heared that if I power the MCP4725 with 5v and try to control it with esp32 i2c pins, itll fry the pins, is that true?)\nb) Stick with esp32 8bit output and somehow higher the output to 5v? ( if this how and with which components)\nc) diffrent Idea?",

I am going to run the whole thing off batteries, and so I've got a really nice latching solenoid valve to turn the water on/off. It's 12v, so I am powering it off a pack of AA's. The rest of the sensors and microcontroller are powered with a solar panel + rechargeable battery at 5v. My concern, is that if my AA batteries die with the solenoid latched open then I could end up in a catastrophic \"water stays on forever\" situation - so I would like to alert (via text, maybe sound) when that occurs. \n\nQuestion to this group is - What's the best / most efficient way to ensure that the water has stopped flowing after I've triggered a \"close the valve\" command? Only thing I've come up with is a flow meter downstream (down pipe) from the valve. Close valve, check for flow of zero, if not zero then alert. \n\nIs there a simpler solution I'm missing here? Maybe one that doesn",

I've spent the last few days writing a CPython motor controller for it, a bit trickier to work with than a normal DC motor but it's getting close to finished.",

I can't imagine the cable being 30cm longer is the culprit.Might this be an issue with how well the connector is making contact? Or the gauge of the wire?

With only one GPIO available, typically an ESP would be run with just the board alone if you were doing a lot of the work over WiFi where BAT might be useful for deploying a board somewhere not near easy plug in power and so having to run off battery and send/receive data via WiFi. Those four pin locations might be better suited for a \"Stemma\" type I2C setup instead where you could daisy chain off sensor and such.  Also another way to gain a bit of space is get rid of the USB connector and put in small pads for the USB connections and then for programming you would use a small jig with pogo pins to connect the pads to a USB connector to hook to your computer. Now with the newfound space you could keep BAT, 3.3V, and GND and increase your GPIO from 1 to 3 or 4. \n\nOr maybe this was a long way of putting it now that I thougt about it more while writing this, you should decide is the board meant to be pow",

Even if it is an inductor I doubt I could match the value, but this is such an expensive part I wanted to at least make the attempt to fix it before I give up and buy another one.

I am trying to be. E.g., these LEDs are not UVC. 365nm is UVA. UVC would be significantly more dangerous.",

That you can just buy these LEDs from AliExpress without so much as a warning on the product page is a bit shocking. It's a bit like selling a weapon. \n\nThey look like innocent little LEDs, and the scary thing is that anyone plugging one in won't even see the UV light that's doing the damage. My understanding is that they'll emit a bit of light in the visible-violet spectrum, but most of their power is invisible. So someone turning one on might actually look at it to see if it's working. At 3W even a reflection is dangerous to one's eyes.\n\nI'm sure some people might think my reaction is over-the-top, but if you read up on what a 3W UVA LED can do, you'd understand. And as a specific warning to @Jcx, no, I wouldn't recommend plugging them in at all. These are not remotely in the realm of consumer/hobbyist-level LEDs.",

I've never seen one that's not wired to GND, but it's always a good idea to check before making a mistake. Here's the schematic for the Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather (which was found on their tutorial's Downloads page). If you look top center you can see the RESET pin section, and then see where it's connected to the chip again on the upper right of the chip schematic (section B-C) on pin 45. It's good to get practice reading the schematics for a board, invaluable when doing anything more complicated.",

When you say \"require power cycling\" - what short of power cycling have you tried? e.g. if were you re-initialize the driver to the card from scratch, does that work, or is the card permanently wedged in some weird state?\n\nIf adding some capacitance to the 3.3V rail doesn't fix your problem, and you have the ability, a quick debug step would be to add some ~10-50 ohm resistors inline with the data signals between the MCU and the microSD card. Add them to the CLK, CS, and MOSI lines on the MCU side, and the MISO line on the SD card side.",

I can't seem to find a easy solution for this so maybe it's the wrong approach. Most of the examples I find are for rechargeable batteries, but I want to use just normal AAs or other replaceable batteries in this project. Thanks for any assistance!",

I have two decoupling caps, and I'm looking to place either 0402 or 0603 caps of 0.1uf and 1uf  there. However, in Eagle, it's, I don't know if I'm doing this right. I don't trust Chat Jippity, and hence I found myself here, this is what it looks like currently, and I have a slight feeling it's not supposed to look like this.\n(why is it tilted at a 30 degree angle... the PCB shape is weird... really weird....)",

To turn off, I set the pin to an input, and turn on the internal pull-down.  This works great, and when the unit goes into deep sleep, the fan stays off, which is desired.\n\nWhen the feather board is connected to my computer via USB-C, and I am monitoring the console output, when it goes into \"fake deep sleep\", the fan stays ON.  Is there a reason the pin should be driven high in this case?   It would be really nice if the pin stayed the way I set it just before \"fake deep sleep\".  Can anyone shed some light on this?",

Like, a value of 0 is 'off', a value of 1 is 'already kinda bright', and then >1 is brighter but not so distinctive. What that means is that hues seem to get kind of 'pushed' towards (1,0,0), (1,1,0), etc kinds of points...

The one thing I'm not sure about Xacto saws is if their blades are okay cutting metal or if they just dull down quickly, meant for plastic and maybe aluminum, dunno. With a hacksaw that's not an issue and the blades are cheap and ubiquitous. I've got several Japanese backsaws but they're beautiful tools and also rather expensive, made for wood, I'd certainly not dull them cutting PC boards. \n\nI don't use phenolic PC boards at all though I have a few in stock. As was mentioned they do tend to just fracture at weird angles, and FR-3/FR-4 is just so much nicer to work with, looks nicer, is stronger, etc. and for my use (robotics) I can't see any reason to use phenolic.

I could fix this in software, as I don't need fast movement anyway, but I'd like to fix it in hardware as well. I tried putting a 100uF capacitor between +5V and GND, this seems to solve the issue. Are there any drawbacks to this that I may not be aware of? Could I just use a larger replacement for C4 instead of two separate capacitors? Don't really have much space left on the PCB.\n\nC4 is electrolytic. The datasheet allows this (page 25), but recommends tantalum for quick load transients. Might that have something to do with it?
